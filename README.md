## Adobe Phtoshop Tutorial

Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard software for **raster graphics editing**, used by professionals worldwide for everything from photo retouching to complex digital art creation.

It is a powerful, feature-rich application developed by Adobe and is a cornerstone of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite.

### Key Uses and Capabilities

Photoshop's versatility makes it essential for various creative industries:

| Category | Primary Use Cases | Key Features Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photography** | Professional photo retouching, color correction, manipulating exposure, removing flaws (blemishes, dust, unwanted objects), and creating composites (combining multiple photos). | **Layers, Adjustment Layers** (Levels, Curves, Hue/Saturation), **Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, Neural Filters**. |
| **Graphic Design** | Creating web graphics, social media posts, ads, custom textures, and mockups for websites and apps. | **Text Tools, Shape Tools, Filters, Layer Styles** (shadows, bevels, strokes), **Artboards**. |
| **Digital Art** | Painting, drawing, creating illustrations, and matte painting from scratch. | **Custom Brushes, Mixer Brush, Pen Tool**, and extensive **Color** and **Swatches** panels. |
| **Image Manipulation** | Changing backgrounds, applying complex special effects, combining different images seamlessly, and creating cinematic visuals. | **Masks, Selection Tools** (Lasso, Quick Selection, Magic Wand), **Blending Modes**, and **Generative Fill (AI)**. |

### Core Photoshop Features

The power of Photoshop comes from its fundamental tools and architecture:

* **Layers and Masks:** The most critical feature, allowing for non-destructive editing by separating different elements (image, text, effects) onto independent, transparent sheets. Masks control the visibility of a layer without permanently erasing content.
* **Selection Tools:** A broad set of tools (Marquee, Lasso, Quick Selection, Pen Tool) used to isolate specific areas of an image for targeted editing.
* **Non-Destructive Editing:** Using Adjustment Layers and Smart Objects allows you to apply corrections and effects that can be easily edited or removed later without degrading the original image pixels.
* **Retouching Tools:** Specialized tools like the Spot Healing Brush and Content-Aware Fill automatically remove unwanted elements, imperfections, or backgrounds.
* **Generative AI (Adobe Firefly):** Modern versions include AI-powered tools like **Generative Fill** and **Generative Expand** which allow users to add, remove, or expand image content using simple text prompts.

## Marquee Tool Group Overview

<img width="300" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9324510a-d6cd-4f1f-9d37-26dd99dbfc91" />

<img width="904" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d31ae4-0749-43f7-b88d-5487d9485ed3" />

The Marquee Tool group in Adobe Photoshop is a fundamental set of tools used to create basic geometric selections. It is the second tool from the top in the default Photoshop toolbar, grouped with other selection tools.

Here are detailed notes on the Marquee Tool group:

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangular Marquee Tool** | **M** | Creates rectangular and square selections. | Rectangle / Square |
| **Elliptical Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Creates elliptical and circular selections. | Ellipse / Circle |
| **Single Row Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-high horizontal row across the entire image. | 1-pixel horizontal line |
| **Single Column Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-wide vertical column across the entire image. | 1-pixel vertical line |


### Key Concepts and Options Bar Settings

When any Marquee Tool is active, the **Options Bar** at the top of the screen provides powerful controls to modify how the selection is drawn and behaved.

<img width="1118" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0218f-670a-4be9-8a4b-502f0c7dd10f" />


#### 1. Selection Modes (The Four Buttons)

These modes determine how a new selection interacts with any existing selection:

| Icon | Mode Name | Shortcut | Function |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | **New Selection** | Default | Creates a new selection, destroying any previous one. |
| | **Add to Selection** | Hold **Shift** | Adds a new area to the existing selection. |
| | **Subtract from Selection** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | Removes an area from the existing selection. |
| | **Intersect with Selection** | Hold **Shift + Alt** (Win) / **Shift + Option** (Mac) | Only the overlapping area between the new and old selection is kept. |

#### 2. Feather (Rectangular/Elliptical Tools Only)

* **Function:** Softens the edges of the selection. The feather radius is measured in pixels.
* **Effect:** A feathered selection creates a gradual transition between the selected area and the surrounding pixels, preventing a harsh cut.

#### 3. Anti-alias (Elliptical Tool Only)

* **Function:** Only available for the **Elliptical Marquee Tool**.
* **Effect:** Blends the edge pixels to create a smoother transition around the curved edge, reducing the jagged "stair-step" effect common with rounded or diagonal lines.

#### 4. Style

The style setting controls the dimensions of the selection outline as you drag:

<img width="183" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213d1b2c-deb5-4106-b5e6-d650d0bebd4e" />


* **Normal (Default):** Allows free-form selection of any width and height.
* **Fixed Ratio:** Allows you to specify a width-to-height ratio (e.g., 1:1 for a square/circle, or 2:1 for a wide rectangle/oval). You drag to size it, but the ratio remains constant.
* **Fixed Size:** Allows you to specify exact pixel dimensions (Width and Height). Clicking once on the canvas will instantly create a selection of that precise size.

---

#### Keyboard Modifiers (While Dragging)

| Action | Modifier Key(s) | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constrain Shape** | Hold **Shift** | Forces the selection to a perfect **square** (Rectangular Tool) or a perfect **circle** (Elliptical Tool). |
| **Draw from Center** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | The selection originates and expands from the point where you initially clicked, rather than from a corner. |
| **Move Selection** | Hold **Spacebar** | Temporarily moves the selection outline *while* you are still drawing it. Release the Spacebar to continue drawing. |
| **Perfect Shape from Center** | Hold **Shift + Alt/Option** | Draws a perfect square or circle expanding symmetrically from the center point. |

---

### Single Row and Single Column Tools

* These tools are highly specialized and are often overlooked.
* They are primarily used for:
    * **Removing artifacts** like single-pixel lines or scratches from old scans.
    * **Creative effects** or precise pixel work, such as sampling or filling a single line of pixels.
* They only require a single click to select an entire row or column, respectively. They do not use the **Feather** or **Style** options.

---

## Selection Brush Tool Group Overview

The **Lasso Tool Group** is a fundamental set of selection tools in Adobe Photoshop, sharing the same icon in the toolbar. These tools are used for creating free-form or polygonal selection outlines, making them ideal for selecting irregular shapes or objects with well-defined edges.

### Lasso Tool Group Overview (L)

<img width="253" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e707b26-754e-49f1-90bc-7482ab1336e7" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lasso Tool** | **L** | Creates a free-form, hand-drawn selection. | Freehand drawing |
| **Polygonal Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection composed of straight-line segments. | Clicking and defining vertices |
| **Magnetic Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection by "snapping" to the edges of high-contrast areas as you trace. | Edge detection (Semi-automatic) |

***

### Key Features and Usage Notes

#### 1. Lasso Tool (Free-form Selection)

<img width="407" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b8cee9-e1f6-439b-93fe-70a26c48cc41" />


* **Usage:** Best for quick, rough selections, or selecting organic/irregular shapes where accuracy isn't critical.
* **Drawing:** Click and drag the mouse to draw the selection outline. The selection is completed when you release the mouse button, connecting the endpoint to the starting point with a straight line.
* **Closing the Selection:** To manually close the selection, return the cursor to the starting point (a small circle appears next to the cursor). If you don't return to the start, Photoshop automatically closes the selection when you release the mouse.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while drawing to temporarily switch to the **Polygonal Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a straight segment mid-selection).

#### 2. Polygonal Lasso Tool (Straight-edge Selection)

<img width="372" height="357" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ef10d8-5dd6-474f-9fb3-3ce2e1956614" />

* **Usage:** Ideal for selecting objects with straight, geometric edges, like buildings, boxes, or lines.
* **Drawing:** Click to define the first point, move the cursor, and click again to set the next point (vertex). Repeat until the shape is traced.
* **Constraining:** Hold **Shift** while clicking to constrain segments to $45^\circ$, $90^\circ$, or $135^\circ$ angles.
* **Closing the Selection:** Double-click to automatically close the selection with a straight line back to the starting point, or click on the starting point.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while clicking to temporarily switch to the **Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a free-form segment mid-selection).

#### 3. Magnetic Lasso Tool (Edge-Snapping Selection)

<img width="386" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9e9e60-1f0c-4b05-b6e0-07daa267f744" />

* **Usage:** Most effective for selecting complex objects against a background with **strong contrast** (clear difference in color/tone).
* **Drawing:** Click to set the first point, then move the cursor along the desired edge. The selection border "snaps" to the edge automatically, dropping anchor points along the way.
* **Manual Anchor Points:** Click the mouse button to manually place an anchor point if the tool starts to drift or is having trouble detecting the edge.
* **Options Bar Controls (Sensitivity):**
    * **Width:** Sets the distance (in pixels) the tool searches from the cursor for an edge. A larger value searches farther.
    * **Edge Contrast:** Determines the sensitivity of the edge detection. A higher value requires more contrast to define an edge.
    * **Frequency:** Controls how often the tool places new anchor points along the edge.

***

#### Common Selection Options (Applies to all Tools)

Like the Marquee tools, the Lasso group uses the **Options Bar** to modify the selection:

* **Selection Modes:** Use **Shift** to **Add to Selection** and **Alt/Option** to **Subtract from Selection**.
* **Feather:** Softens the edge of the selection for blending.
* **Anti-alias:** Available for the free-form and magnetic tools to smooth the diagonal or curved edges.

## Selection Tool Group

<img width="268" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b1f9c42-d823-43ff-9d3a-78c2554a11d6" />



The term "Selection Tool Group" in Photoshop typically refers to the tools that quickly select areas based on content, color, or shape, and are usually grouped around the **Magic Wand Tool** and **Quick Selection Tool** in the toolbar. These tools offer more intelligent, content-aware selection methods compared to the basic Marquee and Lasso tools.

#### Quick Selection Tool (W)

<img width="382" height="365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e24243-ac5b-47c8-9e79-91bfd8448bac" />

<img width="965" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd4782b3-3d1e-49f4-bd83-46cdf0b3e4d0" />

The **Quick Selection Tool** is a brush-like tool that intelligently selects areas by seeking and following image edges and color boundaries as you paint over them.

* **Shortcut:** **W**
* **Primary Function:** To quickly paint a selection based on color, texture, and edge detection.
* **Usage:** Click and drag the tool over the desired area. Photoshop automatically expands the selection outwards until it encounters a strong boundary or edge.
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Size:** The size of the brush cursor affects how quickly and broadly the selection expands.
    * **Auto-Enhance:** When enabled, it helps produce cleaner, more accurate selection edges.
* **Adding/Subtracting:** The tool defaults to **Add to Selection**. Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) to **Subtract from Selection** (the cursor changes to a minus sign).

***

#### Magic Wand Tool (W)

<img width="372" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d85722-de9c-49af-b0b3-08f9d8c03c86" />

<img width="1312" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10c956c-2579-438c-a7fd-ffb67eeaab4f" />

The **Magic Wand Tool** is a classic selection tool that selects pixels based on their similarity in color and tone to the pixel you click.

* **Shortcut:** **W** (It shares the shortcut with the Quick Selection Tool, use **Shift + W** to cycle between them).
* **Primary Function:** To select a uniformly colored or toned area with a single click.
* **Best Use Case:** Isolating solid-colored backgrounds (e.g., a blue sky or a white wall).
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Tolerance:** The most important setting. This value (0-255) defines the range of color values the tool includes in the selection.
        * **Low Tolerance (e.g., 5-10):** Selects only pixels very similar to the clicked pixel (good for precise, narrow color ranges).
        * **High Tolerance (e.g., 50-100):** Selects a broader range of color values (good for gradient areas or larger areas of similar color).
    * **Anti-alias:** Creates a smoother, less jagged edge for the selection.
    * **Contiguous:** When checked (default), it selects only adjacent pixels. When **unchecked**, it selects all pixels across the entire image that fall within the tolerance range, regardless of where they are located.

#### Object Selection Tool (W)

<img width="372" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/974d17e6-705f-419b-9afa-d51316ddfc94" />

<img width="1212" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d7765d9-f482-4e48-ad70-b13a0f01e368" />

The **Object Selection Tool** is a modern, AI-powered tool (introduced in recent Photoshop versions) that identifies and selects objects within an image.

* **Shortcut:** **W** (grouped with the other W tools).
* **Primary Function:** To automatically detect and select a distinct object or area based on a general indication from the user.
* **Usage Modes in Options Bar:**
    * **Rectangle/Lasso:** You draw a simple rectangular or freehand border around the object you want to select. Photoshop's machine learning then identifies the object within that region and creates a precise selection.
    * **Object Finder (Newer Versions):** When enabled, Photoshop hovers over the image and highlights distinct objects, allowing you to click to select them instantly.


| Feature | Quick Selection Tool | Magic Wand Tool | Object Selection Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Selection Type** | Brush-based, edge-aware painting | Single-click, color/tone-based | AI-powered object recognition |
| **Speed** | Very fast for complex, high-contrast objects | Instant for large, uniform areas | Fast, especially for clearly defined objects |
| **Key Setting** | Brush Size / Auto-Enhance | **Tolerance** / Contiguous | Selection Mode (Rectangle/Lasso) |
| **Best for...** | Objects with high texture and clear boundaries. | Solid-colored backgrounds or simple, flat-toned shapes. | Complex, distinct subjects (people, animals, cars) in a photo. |

## Colors Group

The **Colors Group** in Adobe Photoshop refers to the section of the toolbar dedicated to selecting and managing the colors you use for painting, filling, and stroking in your image. This group contains the **Foreground** and **Background** color swatches, along with a few key controls for switching and resetting colors.

## Colors Group Components

<img width="3243" height="1713" alt="Color_tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4682b68-2457-4152-9700-1f0df21eb3df" />


| Element | Icon | Primary Function | Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foreground Color** | The top square swatch. | The color used by painting tools (Brush, Pencil, History Brush) and filling/stroking commands. | **D** (Resets to Default) |
| **Background Color** | The bottom square swatch. | The color used when deleting content on a background layer, revealing content with a layer mask, or filling with the background color command. | **X** (Swaps with Foreground) |
| **Default Foreground and Background Colors** | A small black and white swatch icon. | Resets the Foreground color to **Black** and the Background color to **White**. | **D** |
| **Swap Foreground and Background Colors** | A small curved double-headed arrow. | Quickly exchanges the current Foreground and Background colors. | **X** |

#### Color Panel

<img width="672" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e7312a-6499-4293-8f26-7f73344dd057" />


#### Key Notes on Usage

#### 1. Setting and Selecting Colors

* **To change a color:** Click on either the **Foreground** or **Background** swatch. This opens the **Color Picker** dialog box, allowing you to choose a new color visually, enter specific values (like Hex codes or RGB values), or select from a color library.
* **Sampling from the Image:** When the Color Picker is open, you can move your cursor over the image (it turns into an Eyedropper) to sample any color directly from your artwork.

#### 2. Practical Application

* **Painting/Drawing:** When using the **Brush Tool (B)** or **Pencil Tool**, they will apply the **Foreground Color**.
* **Filling Layers/Selections:**
    * **Fill with Foreground Color:** **Alt + Delete** (Win) / **Option + Delete** (Mac)
    * **Fill with Background Color:** **Ctrl + Delete** (Win) / **Command + Delete** (Mac)
* **Gradients:** The **Gradient Tool (G)** often uses the Foreground and Background colors as the start and end points of a basic gradient.

#### 3. Shortcuts (Essential)

| Action | Shortcut (Windows) | Shortcut (Mac) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reset to Default** (Black Foreground, White Background) | **D** | **D** |

The **Crop Tool Group** in Adobe Photoshop contains essential tools for adjusting the composition, size, and perspective of an image. These tools are grouped together in the toolbar and are primarily used for non-destructive image trimming and straightening.

## Crop Tool Group Overview (C)

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Key Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crop Tool** | **C** | Trims or expands an image and straightens crooked elements. | Resizing and Composition |
| **Perspective Crop Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Corrects perspective distortion caused by shooting an object at an angle. | Geometric Correction |
| **Slice Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Divides an image into smaller, optimized sections for web export. | Web Layout and Export |
| **Slice Select Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Selects, moves, and modifies the slices created by the Slice Tool. | Web Layout Management |


#### 1. Crop Tool (C)

<img width="376" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa83c2d3-0b54-4bd9-93be-d1b5b12557a6" />

The **Crop Tool** is used to remove unwanted parts of an image from the edges and is often the first tool used in the editing workflow to improve composition.

* **Usage:** Drag the corners or sides of the cropping border to define the new boundaries. Press **Enter** (Windows) or **Return** (Mac) to finalize the crop.
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Ratio/Size:** Allows you to set a specific aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 4:5) or exact pixel dimensions for the crop.
    * **Straighten Tool (Ruler Icon):** Click this icon, then draw a line across an element that should be horizontal or vertical (like a horizon). Photoshop automatically rotates the image to straighten the line and adjusts the crop box.
    * **Overlay Options:** Toggles the display of composition guides within the crop area, such as **Rule of Thirds**, **Grid**, and **Golden Ratio**, to aid in better composition.
    * **Delete Cropped Pixels:** When **unchecked** (recommended), the cropped-out areas are simply hidden, preserving the original pixels (non-destructive). When checked, the hidden pixels are permanently discarded.


#### 2. Perspective Crop Tool (Shift + C)

<img width="357" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f5beacb-d2ae-46b1-a5ae-79639435a5f5" />

This specialized tool corrects distortion that makes objects appear to recede in space, typically when a camera is pointed up or down at a subject (like a building).

* **Usage:** Draw a cropping marquee around the distorted object. Then, drag the four corner handles to align the edges of the crop with the vertical and horizontal lines of the distorted object (e.g., the sides and top/bottom of a skewed box).
* **Effect:** When the crop is committed, Photoshop de-skews or "straightens" the image so the once-distorted object appears to be viewed head-on, simultaneously cropping the image.


#### 3. Slice Tool and Slice Select Tool (Shift + C)

<img width="375" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f639bd-c691-426e-89ef-d3dd8f5cb344" />   <img width="371" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73aab51a-5078-4775-b98f-da692baf66cd" />

These tools are primarily legacy features used in web design to prepare large graphics for older or specific web formats.

* **Slice Tool:** Used to draw boundaries (slices) across an image. Each slice is treated as a separate image file when exported.
* **Slice Select Tool:** Used to select, move, resize, and assign specific optimization and naming properties to the individual slices.

* **Modern Context:** These tools have largely been replaced by modern web technologies and the **Export As** function for optimizing images.

## Frame Tool (K)

The **Frame Tool (K)** is a dedicated tool in Adobe Photoshop designed to create placeholder frames that images can be easily dropped into. It is a more modern feature intended to simplify the process of clipping content within defined shapes.

The Frame Tool is typically a standalone tool in the toolbar, often grouped with the Crop and Slice tools, or sometimes by itself if the toolbar is customized.

<img width="376" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06eabd3-2576-4c24-a910-c5738709138e" />

### Frame Tool (K)

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frame Tool** | **K** | Creates rectangular or elliptical content placeholders (frames). | Rectangle or Ellipse |

#### Key Concepts

1.  **Frame Creation:**
    * The Frame Tool creates a **Frame Layer** (indicated by a diagonal cross icon on the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel).
    * Frames are non-destructive; they act as a mask or placeholder for the content inside them.
    * **Rectangular Frame:** Click and drag to draw a rectangular or square frame.
    * **Elliptical Frame:** Hold **Shift** and press **K** to switch to the elliptical shape, then click and drag to draw a circular or elliptical frame.
    * **Creating a Square/Circle:** Hold **Shift** while drawing the frame to constrain it to a perfect square or circle.

2.  **Placing Content:**
    * Once a frame is created, you can simply **drag and drop** an image onto the frame layer from your computer or from within Photoshop.
    * The image automatically scales to fit the frame, and it is **clipped** to the frame's shape.
    * The dropped image becomes a **Smart Object** inside the frame layer, preserving its quality.

3.  **Frame vs. Content:**
    * A frame layer has two components, which you can select and transform independently:
        * **The Frame:** The container itself (the visible border).
        * **The Content:** The image placed *inside* the container.
    * To select the **Content**, click the content thumbnail in the Layers panel. You can then use the **Move Tool (V)** and **Free Transform (Ctrl/Cmd + T)** to resize or reposition the image *inside* the frame without changing the frame's size.
    * To select the **Frame**, click the frame thumbnail (the one with the diagonal cross). You can then resize or reposition the frame itself.

#### Options Bar Controls

When the Frame Tool is active, the Options Bar provides settings for the frame's appearance and behavior:

* **Shape:** You can switch between **Rectangular** and **Elliptical** frames.
* **Style:** You can pre-set the frame to have a **Fixed Ratio** or a **Fixed Size**, similar to the Marquee tools.
* **Frame Border:** While not always a direct option in the tool's Options Bar, you can easily add a border/stroke to the frame layer using the **Properties Panel** (select the Frame layer, and adjust the stroke settings).

#### Advantages

* **Speed:** Simplifies clipping images into shapes, especially useful for layouts and mockups.
* **Flexibility:** Allows independent movement of the image and the container, offering a high degree of control over composition.
* **Non-Destructive:** The original image remains intact, making it easy to swap content or adjust the composition later.

The **Move Tool (V)** and the **Artboard Tool (V)** are grouped together in the Photoshop toolbar, sharing the same keyboard shortcut, and are fundamentally different in what they move: **content** vs. **canvas**.

Here is a breakdown of each tool and their primary differences:

#### 1. Move Tool (V)

The **Move Tool** is the most common tool for manipulating objects *within* a document.

<img width="378" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/167e3913-0cea-4da3-ba38-2d3b5af70445" />

* **Shortcut:** **V**
* **Primary Function:** Moves **layers**, **selections**, and **guides** within the Photoshop document.
* **What it Moves:**
    * Individual layers (images, text boxes, shapes, Smart Objects).
    * Multiple layers (by selecting them in the Layers panel or by holding **Shift** or **Ctrl/Command** while clicking on the canvas).
    * Pixel selections (it "cuts and drags" the pixels to a new location).
* **Key Features/Tips:**
    * **Quick Activation:** You can temporarily activate the Move Tool while another tool is selected by holding down **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (Mac).
    * **Auto-Select:** In the Options bar, enabling **'Auto-Select'** allows you to click directly on an object on the canvas to select its layer without needing to choose it in the Layers panel.
    * **Transform Controls:** When **'Show Transform Controls'** is enabled in the Options bar, you can quickly **resize and rotate** the selected layer(s) by dragging the handles around the object.
    * **Copying:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while dragging a layer or selection to quickly duplicate and move a copy.



#### 2. Artboard Tool (V)

The **Artboard Tool** is used to create and manipulate a special type of layer container called an **Artboard**, which is essentially a separate canvas within a single Photoshop document.

<img width="378" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcc66fa-2523-4383-95f7-74db72e15441" />

* **Shortcut:** **V** (Click and hold the Move Tool icon to select the Artboard Tool, or use **Shift + V** to cycle between the grouped tools).
* **Primary Function:** Manages the **Artboard container**—creating new artboards, resizing them, and moving them around the workspace.
* **What it Moves/Creates:**
    * It creates a **container** that holds layers, text, and Smart Objects, allowing you to design for multiple screen sizes or layouts in one file.
    * It can move the entire **Artboard** around the document window workspace.
    * It allows you to **resize** the boundaries of the artboard by dragging the handles.


#### Move Tool vs. Artboard Tool: Main Differences

| Feature | Move Tool | Artboard Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target of Movement** | **Content** (layers, groups, selections, guides). | **Canvas/Container** (the Artboard itself). |
| **Purpose** | Arranging elements **on** the canvas or artboard. | Setting up and managing multiple, separate canvases (artboards) **within** one file. |
| **Activation** | Default on **V**. Temporarily activated with **Ctrl/Command**. | Grouped with the Move Tool; typically accessed by holding the Move Tool or using **Shift + V**. |
| **Artboard Interaction** | Moves the **contents** *inside* the artboard. | Moves the **entire artboard** and its contents across the workspace. |
