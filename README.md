## Adobe Phtoshop Tutorial

Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard software for **raster graphics editing**, used by professionals worldwide for everything from photo retouching to complex digital art creation.

It is a powerful, feature-rich application developed by Adobe and is a cornerstone of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite.

### Key Uses and Capabilities

Photoshop's versatility makes it essential for various creative industries:

| Category | Primary Use Cases | Key Features Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photography** | Professional photo retouching, color correction, manipulating exposure, removing flaws (blemishes, dust, unwanted objects), and creating composites (combining multiple photos). | **Layers, Adjustment Layers** (Levels, Curves, Hue/Saturation), **Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, Neural Filters**. |
| **Graphic Design** | Creating web graphics, social media posts, ads, custom textures, and mockups for websites and apps. | **Text Tools, Shape Tools, Filters, Layer Styles** (shadows, bevels, strokes), **Artboards**. |
| **Digital Art** | Painting, drawing, creating illustrations, and matte painting from scratch. | **Custom Brushes, Mixer Brush, Pen Tool**, and extensive **Color** and **Swatches** panels. |
| **Image Manipulation** | Changing backgrounds, applying complex special effects, combining different images seamlessly, and creating cinematic visuals. | **Masks, Selection Tools** (Lasso, Quick Selection, Magic Wand), **Blending Modes**, and **Generative Fill (AI)**. |

### Core Photoshop Features

The power of Photoshop comes from its fundamental tools and architecture:

* **Layers and Masks:** The most critical feature, allowing for non-destructive editing by separating different elements (image, text, effects) onto independent, transparent sheets. Masks control the visibility of a layer without permanently erasing content.
* **Selection Tools:** A broad set of tools (Marquee, Lasso, Quick Selection, Pen Tool) used to isolate specific areas of an image for targeted editing.
* **Non-Destructive Editing:** Using Adjustment Layers and Smart Objects allows you to apply corrections and effects that can be easily edited or removed later without degrading the original image pixels.
* **Retouching Tools:** Specialized tools like the Spot Healing Brush and Content-Aware Fill automatically remove unwanted elements, imperfections, or backgrounds.
* **Generative AI (Adobe Firefly):** Modern versions include AI-powered tools like **Generative Fill** and **Generative Expand** which allow users to add, remove, or expand image content using simple text prompts.

### Move Tool Group Overview

<img width="272" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdc4d9b-37a0-4f87-9dcc-39c279e37eee" />

The **Move Tool (V)** and the **Artboard Tool (V)** are grouped together in the Photoshop toolbar, sharing the same keyboard shortcut, and are fundamentally different in what they move: **content** vs. **canvas**.

Here is a breakdown of each tool and their primary differences:

#### 1. Move Tool (V)

The **Move Tool** is the most common tool for manipulating objects *within* a document.

* **Shortcut:** **V**
* **Primary Function:** Moves **layers**, **selections**, and **guides** within the Photoshop document.
* **What it Moves:**
    * Individual layers (images, text boxes, shapes, Smart Objects).
    * Multiple layers (by selecting them in the Layers panel or by holding **Shift** or **Ctrl/Command** while clicking on the canvas).
    * Pixel selections (it "cuts and drags" the pixels to a new location).
* **Key Features/Tips:**
    * **Quick Activation:** You can temporarily activate the Move Tool while another tool is selected by holding down **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (Mac).
    * **Auto-Select:** In the Options bar, enabling **'Auto-Select'** allows you to click directly on an object on the canvas to select its layer without needing to choose it in the Layers panel.
    * **Transform Controls:** When **'Show Transform Controls'** is enabled in the Options bar, you can quickly **resize and rotate** the selected layer(s) by dragging the handles around the object.
    * **Copying:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while dragging a layer or selection to quickly duplicate and move a copy.



#### 2. Artboard Tool (V)

The **Artboard Tool** is used to create and manipulate a special type of layer container called an **Artboard**, which is essentially a separate canvas within a single Photoshop document.

* **Shortcut:** **V** (Click and hold the Move Tool icon to select the Artboard Tool, or use **Shift + V** to cycle between the grouped tools).
* **Primary Function:** Manages the **Artboard container**—creating new artboards, resizing them, and moving them around the workspace.
* **What it Moves/Creates:**
    * It creates a **container** that holds layers, text, and Smart Objects, allowing you to design for multiple screen sizes or layouts in one file.
    * It can move the entire **Artboard** around the document window workspace.
    * It allows you to **resize** the boundaries of the artboard by dragging the handles.


#### Move Tool vs. Artboard Tool: Main Differences

| Feature | Move Tool | Artboard Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target of Movement** | **Content** (layers, groups, selections, guides). | **Canvas/Container** (the Artboard itself). |
| **Purpose** | Arranging elements **on** the canvas or artboard. | Setting up and managing multiple, separate canvases (artboards) **within** one file. |
| **Activation** | Default on **V**. Temporarily activated with **Ctrl/Command**. | Grouped with the Move Tool; typically accessed by holding the Move Tool or using **Shift + V**. |
| **Artboard Interaction** | Moves the **contents** *inside* the artboard. | Moves the **entire artboard** and its contents across the workspace. |


The Marquee Tool group in Adobe Photoshop is a fundamental set of tools used to create basic geometric selections. It is the second tool from the top in the default Photoshop toolbar, grouped with other selection tools.

Here are detailed notes on the Marquee Tool group:

---
## Marquee Tool Group Overview

<img width="300" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9324510a-d6cd-4f1f-9d37-26dd99dbfc91" />

<img width="904" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d31ae4-0749-43f7-b88d-5487d9485ed3" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangular Marquee Tool** | **M** | Creates rectangular and square selections. | Rectangle / Square |
| **Elliptical Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Creates elliptical and circular selections. | Ellipse / Circle |
| **Single Row Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-high horizontal row across the entire image. | 1-pixel horizontal line |
| **Single Column Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-wide vertical column across the entire image. | 1-pixel vertical line |


### Key Concepts and Options Bar Settings

When any Marquee Tool is active, the **Options Bar** at the top of the screen provides powerful controls to modify how the selection is drawn and behaved.

<img width="1118" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0218f-670a-4be9-8a4b-502f0c7dd10f" />


#### 1. Selection Modes (The Four Buttons)

These modes determine how a new selection interacts with any existing selection:

| Icon | Mode Name | Shortcut | Function |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | **New Selection** | Default | Creates a new selection, destroying any previous one. |
| | **Add to Selection** | Hold **Shift** | Adds a new area to the existing selection. |
| | **Subtract from Selection** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | Removes an area from the existing selection. |
| | **Intersect with Selection** | Hold **Shift + Alt** (Win) / **Shift + Option** (Mac) | Only the overlapping area between the new and old selection is kept. |

#### 2. Feather (Rectangular/Elliptical Tools Only)

* **Function:** Softens the edges of the selection. The feather radius is measured in pixels.
* **Effect:** A feathered selection creates a gradual transition between the selected area and the surrounding pixels, preventing a harsh cut.

#### 3. Anti-alias (Elliptical Tool Only)

* **Function:** Only available for the **Elliptical Marquee Tool**.
* **Effect:** Blends the edge pixels to create a smoother transition around the curved edge, reducing the jagged "stair-step" effect common with rounded or diagonal lines.

#### 4. Style

The style setting controls the dimensions of the selection outline as you drag:

<img width="183" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213d1b2c-deb5-4106-b5e6-d650d0bebd4e" />


* **Normal (Default):** Allows free-form selection of any width and height.
* **Fixed Ratio:** Allows you to specify a width-to-height ratio (e.g., 1:1 for a square/circle, or 2:1 for a wide rectangle/oval). You drag to size it, but the ratio remains constant.
* **Fixed Size:** Allows you to specify exact pixel dimensions (Width and Height). Clicking once on the canvas will instantly create a selection of that precise size.

---

#### Keyboard Modifiers (While Dragging)

| Action | Modifier Key(s) | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constrain Shape** | Hold **Shift** | Forces the selection to a perfect **square** (Rectangular Tool) or a perfect **circle** (Elliptical Tool). |
| **Draw from Center** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | The selection originates and expands from the point where you initially clicked, rather than from a corner. |
| **Move Selection** | Hold **Spacebar** | Temporarily moves the selection outline *while* you are still drawing it. Release the Spacebar to continue drawing. |
| **Perfect Shape from Center** | Hold **Shift + Alt/Option** | Draws a perfect square or circle expanding symmetrically from the center point. |

---

### Single Row and Single Column Tools

* These tools are highly specialized and are often overlooked.
* They are primarily used for:
    * **Removing artifacts** like single-pixel lines or scratches from old scans.
    * **Creative effects** or precise pixel work, such as sampling or filling a single line of pixels.
* They only require a single click to select an entire row or column, respectively. They do not use the **Feather** or **Style** options.

---

## Selection Brush Tool Group Overview

The **Lasso Tool Group** is a fundamental set of selection tools in Adobe Photoshop, sharing the same icon in the toolbar. These tools are used for creating free-form or polygonal selection outlines, making them ideal for selecting irregular shapes or objects with well-defined edges.

### Lasso Tool Group Overview (L)

<img width="253" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e707b26-754e-49f1-90bc-7482ab1336e7" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lasso Tool** | **L** | Creates a free-form, hand-drawn selection. | Freehand drawing |
| **Polygonal Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection composed of straight-line segments. | Clicking and defining vertices |
| **Magnetic Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection by "snapping" to the edges of high-contrast areas as you trace. | Edge detection (Semi-automatic) |

***

### Key Features and Usage Notes

#### 1. Lasso Tool (Free-form Selection)

<img width="407" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b8cee9-e1f6-439b-93fe-70a26c48cc41" />


* **Usage:** Best for quick, rough selections, or selecting organic/irregular shapes where accuracy isn't critical.
* **Drawing:** Click and drag the mouse to draw the selection outline. The selection is completed when you release the mouse button, connecting the endpoint to the starting point with a straight line.
* **Closing the Selection:** To manually close the selection, return the cursor to the starting point (a small circle appears next to the cursor). If you don't return to the start, Photoshop automatically closes the selection when you release the mouse.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while drawing to temporarily switch to the **Polygonal Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a straight segment mid-selection).

#### 2. Polygonal Lasso Tool (Straight-edge Selection)

<img width="372" height="357" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ef10d8-5dd6-474f-9fb3-3ce2e1956614" />

* **Usage:** Ideal for selecting objects with straight, geometric edges, like buildings, boxes, or lines.
* **Drawing:** Click to define the first point, move the cursor, and click again to set the next point (vertex). Repeat until the shape is traced.
* **Constraining:** Hold **Shift** while clicking to constrain segments to $45^\circ$, $90^\circ$, or $135^\circ$ angles.
* **Closing the Selection:** Double-click to automatically close the selection with a straight line back to the starting point, or click on the starting point.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while clicking to temporarily switch to the **Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a free-form segment mid-selection).

#### 3. Magnetic Lasso Tool (Edge-Snapping Selection)

<img width="386" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9e9e60-1f0c-4b05-b6e0-07daa267f744" />

* **Usage:** Most effective for selecting complex objects against a background with **strong contrast** (clear difference in color/tone).
* **Drawing:** Click to set the first point, then move the cursor along the desired edge. The selection border "snaps" to the edge automatically, dropping anchor points along the way.
* **Manual Anchor Points:** Click the mouse button to manually place an anchor point if the tool starts to drift or is having trouble detecting the edge.
* **Options Bar Controls (Sensitivity):**
    * **Width:** Sets the distance (in pixels) the tool searches from the cursor for an edge. A larger value searches farther.
    * **Edge Contrast:** Determines the sensitivity of the edge detection. A higher value requires more contrast to define an edge.
    * **Frequency:** Controls how often the tool places new anchor points along the edge.

***

#### Common Selection Options (Applies to all Tools)

Like the Marquee tools, the Lasso group uses the **Options Bar** to modify the selection:

* **Selection Modes:** Use **Shift** to **Add to Selection** and **Alt/Option** to **Subtract from Selection**.
* **Feather:** Softens the edge of the selection for blending.
* **Anti-alias:** Available for the free-form and magnetic tools to smooth the diagonal or curved edges.
