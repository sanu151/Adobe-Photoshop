## Adobe Phtoshop Tutorial

Adobe Photoshop is the industry-standard software for **raster graphics editing**, used by professionals worldwide for everything from photo retouching to complex digital art creation.

It is a powerful, feature-rich application developed by Adobe and is a cornerstone of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite.

### Key Uses and Capabilities

Photoshop's versatility makes it essential for various creative industries:

| Category | Primary Use Cases | Key Features Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Photography** | Professional photo retouching, color correction, manipulating exposure, removing flaws (blemishes, dust, unwanted objects), and creating composites (combining multiple photos). | **Layers, Adjustment Layers** (Levels, Curves, Hue/Saturation), **Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, Neural Filters**. |
| **Graphic Design** | Creating web graphics, social media posts, ads, custom textures, and mockups for websites and apps. | **Text Tools, Shape Tools, Filters, Layer Styles** (shadows, bevels, strokes), **Artboards**. |
| **Digital Art** | Painting, drawing, creating illustrations, and matte painting from scratch. | **Custom Brushes, Mixer Brush, Pen Tool**, and extensive **Color** and **Swatches** panels. |
| **Image Manipulation** | Changing backgrounds, applying complex special effects, combining different images seamlessly, and creating cinematic visuals. | **Masks, Selection Tools** (Lasso, Quick Selection, Magic Wand), **Blending Modes**, and **Generative Fill (AI)**. |

### Core Photoshop Features

The power of Photoshop comes from its fundamental tools and architecture:

* **Layers and Masks:** The most critical feature, allowing for non-destructive editing by separating different elements (image, text, effects) onto independent, transparent sheets. Masks control the visibility of a layer without permanently erasing content.
* **Selection Tools:** A broad set of tools (Marquee, Lasso, Quick Selection, Pen Tool) used to isolate specific areas of an image for targeted editing.
* **Non-Destructive Editing:** Using Adjustment Layers and Smart Objects allows you to apply corrections and effects that can be easily edited or removed later without degrading the original image pixels.
* **Retouching Tools:** Specialized tools like the Spot Healing Brush and Content-Aware Fill automatically remove unwanted elements, imperfections, or backgrounds.
* **Generative AI (Adobe Firefly):** Modern versions include AI-powered tools like **Generative Fill** and **Generative Expand** which allow users to add, remove, or expand image content using simple text prompts.

## Marquee Tool Group Overview

<img width="300" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9324510a-d6cd-4f1f-9d37-26dd99dbfc91" />

<img width="904" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d31ae4-0749-43f7-b88d-5487d9485ed3" />

The Marquee Tool group in Adobe Photoshop is a fundamental set of tools used to create basic geometric selections. It is the second tool from the top in the default Photoshop toolbar, grouped with other selection tools.

Here are detailed notes on the Marquee Tool group:

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangular Marquee Tool** | **M** | Creates rectangular and square selections. | Rectangle / Square |
| **Elliptical Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Creates elliptical and circular selections. | Ellipse / Circle |
| **Single Row Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-high horizontal row across the entire image. | 1-pixel horizontal line |
| **Single Column Marquee Tool** | **Shift + M** (cycle) | Selects a single, 1-pixel-wide vertical column across the entire image. | 1-pixel vertical line |


### Key Concepts and Options Bar Settings

When any Marquee Tool is active, the **Options Bar** at the top of the screen provides powerful controls to modify how the selection is drawn and behaved.

<img width="1118" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc0218f-670a-4be9-8a4b-502f0c7dd10f" />


#### 1. Selection Modes (The Four Buttons)

These modes determine how a new selection interacts with any existing selection:

| Icon | Mode Name | Shortcut | Function |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | **New Selection** | Default | Creates a new selection, destroying any previous one. |
| | **Add to Selection** | Hold **Shift** | Adds a new area to the existing selection. |
| | **Subtract from Selection** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | Removes an area from the existing selection. |
| | **Intersect with Selection** | Hold **Shift + Alt** (Win) / **Shift + Option** (Mac) | Only the overlapping area between the new and old selection is kept. |

#### 2. Feather (Rectangular/Elliptical Tools Only)

* **Function:** Softens the edges of the selection. The feather radius is measured in pixels.
* **Effect:** A feathered selection creates a gradual transition between the selected area and the surrounding pixels, preventing a harsh cut.

#### 3. Anti-alias (Elliptical Tool Only)

* **Function:** Only available for the **Elliptical Marquee Tool**.
* **Effect:** Blends the edge pixels to create a smoother transition around the curved edge, reducing the jagged "stair-step" effect common with rounded or diagonal lines.

#### 4. Style

The style setting controls the dimensions of the selection outline as you drag:

<img width="183" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213d1b2c-deb5-4106-b5e6-d650d0bebd4e" />


* **Normal (Default):** Allows free-form selection of any width and height.
* **Fixed Ratio:** Allows you to specify a width-to-height ratio (e.g., 1:1 for a square/circle, or 2:1 for a wide rectangle/oval). You drag to size it, but the ratio remains constant.
* **Fixed Size:** Allows you to specify exact pixel dimensions (Width and Height). Clicking once on the canvas will instantly create a selection of that precise size.

---

#### Keyboard Modifiers (While Dragging)

| Action | Modifier Key(s) | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constrain Shape** | Hold **Shift** | Forces the selection to a perfect **square** (Rectangular Tool) or a perfect **circle** (Elliptical Tool). |
| **Draw from Center** | Hold **Alt** (Win) / **Option** (Mac) | The selection originates and expands from the point where you initially clicked, rather than from a corner. |
| **Move Selection** | Hold **Spacebar** | Temporarily moves the selection outline *while* you are still drawing it. Release the Spacebar to continue drawing. |
| **Perfect Shape from Center** | Hold **Shift + Alt/Option** | Draws a perfect square or circle expanding symmetrically from the center point. |

---

### Single Row and Single Column Tools

* These tools are highly specialized and are often overlooked.
* They are primarily used for:
    * **Removing artifacts** like single-pixel lines or scratches from old scans.
    * **Creative effects** or precise pixel work, such as sampling or filling a single line of pixels.
* They only require a single click to select an entire row or column, respectively. They do not use the **Feather** or **Style** options.

---

## Selection Brush Tool Group Overview

The **Lasso Tool Group** is a fundamental set of selection tools in Adobe Photoshop, sharing the same icon in the toolbar. These tools are used for creating free-form or polygonal selection outlines, making them ideal for selecting irregular shapes or objects with well-defined edges.

### Lasso Tool Group Overview (L)

<img width="253" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e707b26-754e-49f1-90bc-7482ab1336e7" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lasso Tool** | **L** | Creates a free-form, hand-drawn selection. | Freehand drawing |
| **Polygonal Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection composed of straight-line segments. | Clicking and defining vertices |
| **Magnetic Lasso Tool** | **Shift + L** (cycle) | Creates a selection by "snapping" to the edges of high-contrast areas as you trace. | Edge detection (Semi-automatic) |

***

### Key Features and Usage Notes

#### 1. Lasso Tool (Free-form Selection)

<img width="407" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b8cee9-e1f6-439b-93fe-70a26c48cc41" />


* **Usage:** Best for quick, rough selections, or selecting organic/irregular shapes where accuracy isn't critical.
* **Drawing:** Click and drag the mouse to draw the selection outline. The selection is completed when you release the mouse button, connecting the endpoint to the starting point with a straight line.
* **Closing the Selection:** To manually close the selection, return the cursor to the starting point (a small circle appears next to the cursor). If you don't return to the start, Photoshop automatically closes the selection when you release the mouse.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while drawing to temporarily switch to the **Polygonal Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a straight segment mid-selection).

#### 2. Polygonal Lasso Tool (Straight-edge Selection)

<img width="372" height="357" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ef10d8-5dd6-474f-9fb3-3ce2e1956614" />

* **Usage:** Ideal for selecting objects with straight, geometric edges, like buildings, boxes, or lines.
* **Drawing:** Click to define the first point, move the cursor, and click again to set the next point (vertex). Repeat until the shape is traced.
* **Constraining:** Hold **Shift** while clicking to constrain segments to $45^\circ$, $90^\circ$, or $135^\circ$ angles.
* **Closing the Selection:** Double-click to automatically close the selection with a straight line back to the starting point, or click on the starting point.
* **Temporary Switch:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while clicking to temporarily switch to the **Lasso Tool** (allowing you to draw a free-form segment mid-selection).

#### 3. Magnetic Lasso Tool (Edge-Snapping Selection)

<img width="386" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9e9e60-1f0c-4b05-b6e0-07daa267f744" />

* **Usage:** Most effective for selecting complex objects against a background with **strong contrast** (clear difference in color/tone).
* **Drawing:** Click to set the first point, then move the cursor along the desired edge. The selection border "snaps" to the edge automatically, dropping anchor points along the way.
* **Manual Anchor Points:** Click the mouse button to manually place an anchor point if the tool starts to drift or is having trouble detecting the edge.
* **Options Bar Controls (Sensitivity):**
    * **Width:** Sets the distance (in pixels) the tool searches from the cursor for an edge. A larger value searches farther.
    * **Edge Contrast:** Determines the sensitivity of the edge detection. A higher value requires more contrast to define an edge.
    * **Frequency:** Controls how often the tool places new anchor points along the edge.

***

#### Common Selection Options (Applies to all Tools)

Like the Marquee tools, the Lasso group uses the **Options Bar** to modify the selection:

* **Selection Modes:** Use **Shift** to **Add to Selection** and **Alt/Option** to **Subtract from Selection**.
* **Feather:** Softens the edge of the selection for blending.
* **Anti-alias:** Available for the free-form and magnetic tools to smooth the diagonal or curved edges.

## Selection Tool Group

<img width="268" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b1f9c42-d823-43ff-9d3a-78c2554a11d6" />



The term "Selection Tool Group" in Photoshop typically refers to the tools that quickly select areas based on content, color, or shape, and are usually grouped around the **Magic Wand Tool** and **Quick Selection Tool** in the toolbar. These tools offer more intelligent, content-aware selection methods compared to the basic Marquee and Lasso tools.

#### Quick Selection Tool (W)

<img width="382" height="365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e24243-ac5b-47c8-9e79-91bfd8448bac" />

<img width="965" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd4782b3-3d1e-49f4-bd83-46cdf0b3e4d0" />

The **Quick Selection Tool** is a brush-like tool that intelligently selects areas by seeking and following image edges and color boundaries as you paint over them.

* **Shortcut:** **W**
* **Primary Function:** To quickly paint a selection based on color, texture, and edge detection.
* **Usage:** Click and drag the tool over the desired area. Photoshop automatically expands the selection outwards until it encounters a strong boundary or edge.
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Size:** The size of the brush cursor affects how quickly and broadly the selection expands.
    * **Auto-Enhance:** When enabled, it helps produce cleaner, more accurate selection edges.
* **Adding/Subtracting:** The tool defaults to **Add to Selection**. Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) to **Subtract from Selection** (the cursor changes to a minus sign).

***

#### Magic Wand Tool (W)

<img width="372" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d85722-de9c-49af-b0b3-08f9d8c03c86" />

<img width="1312" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10c956c-2579-438c-a7fd-ffb67eeaab4f" />

The **Magic Wand Tool** is a classic selection tool that selects pixels based on their similarity in color and tone to the pixel you click.

* **Shortcut:** **W** (It shares the shortcut with the Quick Selection Tool, use **Shift + W** to cycle between them).
* **Primary Function:** To select a uniformly colored or toned area with a single click.
* **Best Use Case:** Isolating solid-colored backgrounds (e.g., a blue sky or a white wall).
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Tolerance:** The most important setting. This value (0-255) defines the range of color values the tool includes in the selection.
        * **Low Tolerance (e.g., 5-10):** Selects only pixels very similar to the clicked pixel (good for precise, narrow color ranges).
        * **High Tolerance (e.g., 50-100):** Selects a broader range of color values (good for gradient areas or larger areas of similar color).
    * **Anti-alias:** Creates a smoother, less jagged edge for the selection.
    * **Contiguous:** When checked (default), it selects only adjacent pixels. When **unchecked**, it selects all pixels across the entire image that fall within the tolerance range, regardless of where they are located.

#### Object Selection Tool (W)

<img width="372" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/974d17e6-705f-419b-9afa-d51316ddfc94" />

<img width="1212" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d7765d9-f482-4e48-ad70-b13a0f01e368" />

The **Object Selection Tool** is a modern, AI-powered tool (introduced in recent Photoshop versions) that identifies and selects objects within an image.

* **Shortcut:** **W** (grouped with the other W tools).
* **Primary Function:** To automatically detect and select a distinct object or area based on a general indication from the user.
* **Usage Modes in Options Bar:**
    * **Rectangle/Lasso:** You draw a simple rectangular or freehand border around the object you want to select. Photoshop's machine learning then identifies the object within that region and creates a precise selection.
    * **Object Finder (Newer Versions):** When enabled, Photoshop hovers over the image and highlights distinct objects, allowing you to click to select them instantly.


| Feature | Quick Selection Tool | Magic Wand Tool | Object Selection Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Selection Type** | Brush-based, edge-aware painting | Single-click, color/tone-based | AI-powered object recognition |
| **Speed** | Very fast for complex, high-contrast objects | Instant for large, uniform areas | Fast, especially for clearly defined objects |
| **Key Setting** | Brush Size / Auto-Enhance | **Tolerance** / Contiguous | Selection Mode (Rectangle/Lasso) |
| **Best for...** | Objects with high texture and clear boundaries. | Solid-colored backgrounds or simple, flat-toned shapes. | Complex, distinct subjects (people, animals, cars) in a photo. |

## Colors Group

The **Colors Group** in Adobe Photoshop refers to the section of the toolbar dedicated to selecting and managing the colors you use for painting, filling, and stroking in your image. This group contains the **Foreground** and **Background** color swatches, along with a few key controls for switching and resetting colors.

## Colors Group Components

<img width="3243" height="1713" alt="Color_tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4682b68-2457-4152-9700-1f0df21eb3df" />


| Element | Icon | Primary Function | Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foreground Color** | The top square swatch. | The color used by painting tools (Brush, Pencil, History Brush) and filling/stroking commands. | **D** (Resets to Default) |
| **Background Color** | The bottom square swatch. | The color used when deleting content on a background layer, revealing content with a layer mask, or filling with the background color command. | **X** (Swaps with Foreground) |
| **Default Foreground and Background Colors** | A small black and white swatch icon. | Resets the Foreground color to **Black** and the Background color to **White**. | **D** |
| **Swap Foreground and Background Colors** | A small curved double-headed arrow. | Quickly exchanges the current Foreground and Background colors. | **X** |

#### Color Panel

<img width="672" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e7312a-6499-4293-8f26-7f73344dd057" />


#### Key Notes on Usage

#### 1. Setting and Selecting Colors

* **To change a color:** Click on either the **Foreground** or **Background** swatch. This opens the **Color Picker** dialog box, allowing you to choose a new color visually, enter specific values (like Hex codes or RGB values), or select from a color library.
* **Sampling from the Image:** When the Color Picker is open, you can move your cursor over the image (it turns into an Eyedropper) to sample any color directly from your artwork.

#### 2. Practical Application

* **Painting/Drawing:** When using the **Brush Tool (B)** or **Pencil Tool**, they will apply the **Foreground Color**.
* **Filling Layers/Selections:**
    * **Fill with Foreground Color:** **Alt + Delete** (Win) / **Option + Delete** (Mac)
    * **Fill with Background Color:** **Ctrl + Delete** (Win) / **Command + Delete** (Mac)
* **Gradients:** The **Gradient Tool (G)** often uses the Foreground and Background colors as the start and end points of a basic gradient.

#### 3. Shortcuts (Essential)

| Action | Shortcut (Windows) | Shortcut (Mac) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reset to Default** (Black Foreground, White Background) | **D** | **D** |
| **Swap Foreground/Background** | **X** | **X** |

## Layers

Layers are the fundamental building blocks of an Adobe Photoshop file, allowing you to edit and manipulate specific elements of an image independently without permanently altering other parts. Think of them as transparent sheets stacked on top of one another.

<img width="3750" height="3142" alt="layers_photoshop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460a47a7-e86d-417b-9f06-b7aa195f1731" />

#### 1. The Concept of Layers 📄

* **Non-Destructive Editing:** Layers enable non-destructive workflow, meaning you can make changes (paint, adjust color, apply filters) to one layer without permanently changing the pixels on other layers.
* **Layer Stack:** The order of layers in the **Layers Panel** determines how they appear in the document. Layers at the top of the stack cover or obscure the layers beneath them.
* **Transparency:** Any area of a layer where there are no pixels is transparent, allowing the layers underneath to show through.


#### 2. The Layers Panel

The Layers Panel is the control center for managing all layers in your document.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer Thumbnail** | A miniature preview of the layer's content. |
| **Layer Name** | Double-click to rename a layer (e.g., "Background," "Text," "Shadow"). |
| **Visibility Toggle** | The **eye icon** 👀. Click to hide or show the layer's content. |
| **Active Layer** | The selected layer is highlighted, indicating that any action (painting, filtering) will affect only that layer. |
| **Background Layer** | The bottom-most layer, often locked (🔒). It is typically the original image. You must **convert it to a regular layer** (double-click the lock) to use full editing features. |

#### Key Panel Controls (Bottom of the Panel)

| Icon | Function | Shortcut |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🗑️ | **Delete Layer** | **Delete** (key) |
| ➕ | **Create New Layer** | **Ctrl + Shift + N** (Win) / **Cmd + Shift + N** (Mac) |
| 🗂️ | **Create New Group** | **Ctrl + G** (Win) / **Cmd + G** (Mac) (Groups selected layers) |
| 🔳 | **Add Layer Mask** | Creates a mask to hide or reveal parts of a layer non-destructively. |
| ⚫ | **Add Adjustment Layer** | Creates a layer for color and tone adjustments (e.g., Hue/Saturation, Curves). |
| $\text{fx}$ | **Add Layer Style** | Opens dialog to add effects like Drop Shadow, Stroke, Bevel & Emboss. |



#### 3. Layer Properties

#### A. Opacity and Fill

* **Opacity:** Controls the overall transparency of the entire layer and all its contents and effects. $100\%$ is fully visible; $0\%$ is completely invisible.
* **Fill:** Controls the transparency of only the layer's pixels, *leaving any Layer Styles (like a stroke or drop shadow) fully opaque*. This is useful for creating complex effects where the object itself is transparent but its shadow remains visible.

#### B. Blending Modes

Blending modes define how a layer's pixels interact with or "blend" with the pixels on the layers directly beneath it.

<img width="276" height="753" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2108f55c-2fa8-4cf2-b398-6631639bf55a" />

They are categorized based on their function:

| Category | Example Modes | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | Normal, Dissolve | No change or simple pixel alteration. |
| **Darkening** | **Multiply**, Color Burn | Makes the image darker; used for coloring shadows. |
| **Lightening** | **Screen**, Color Dodge | Makes the image lighter; used for coloring highlights and glows. |
| **Contrast** | **Overlay**, Soft Light | Increases contrast; uses different blending formulas for light and dark areas. |
| **Inversion** | Difference, Exclusion | Compares colors for artistic/abstract effects. |
| **Component** | Hue, Saturation, **Color**, Luminosity | Blends only specific color components (e.g., the hue from the top layer but the brightness from the bottom). |

#### C. Lock Layers

Locking layers in Adobe Photoshop is a critical function for protecting specific layer content from accidental or unwanted edits. You can lock layers using various options in the **Layers Panel**, which allow you to control exactly what kind of editing is prevented.

##### 1. How to Lock Layers

The lock controls are located at the top of the **Layers Panel**, just above the layer list.

1.  **Select the Layer:** Click on the layer you want to protect.
2.  **Apply Lock:** Click the desired lock icon(s) to activate protection. When any lock is active, the main **Lock icon** ($\text{🔒}$) on the far right will appear.

##### 2. Layer Lock Options

Photoshop offers four specific lock options, plus a master lock:

| Icon | Lock Type | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🖌️ | **Lock Transparent Pixels** (Lock $\text{Opacity}$) | Prevents you from painting or editing any transparent area of the layer. You can only apply paint, filters, or adjustments to areas that *already contain pixels*. |
| 🎨 | **Lock Image Pixels** (Lock $\text{Image}$) | Prevents you from changing the color or tone of existing pixels. This stops all painting, brush, fill, and filter operations on the layer. |
| ↔️ | **Lock Position** (Lock $\text{Position}$) | Prevents the layer content from being moved when using the **Move Tool (V)**. It locks the layer's position on the canvas. |
| 🖼️ | **Lock All** (Lock $\text{Artboards and Frames}$) | Locks everything, including transparent pixels, image pixels, and position. This is the complete protection lock. It is often labeled as "Lock All" in the newer Photoshop versions, especially for artboards and frames. |
| $\text{🔒}$ | **Master Lock Indicator** | This large icon lights up whenever any of the specific locks (Opacity, Image, Position) are active, indicating the layer is protected. |

##### 3. Practical Use Cases

| Lock Type | Example Use Case | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lock Transparent Pixels** ($\text{🖌️}$) | Coloring a line drawing. | Allows you to quickly paint and color within the lines of a sketch without worrying about painting outside the edges. |
| **Lock Image Pixels** ($\text{🎨}$) | Protecting a finished texture layer. | Ensures you don't accidentally paint or apply a filter to a crucial element that should not change visually. |
| **Lock Position** ($\text{↔️}$) | Securing a background or a grid layout. | Keeps essential, perfectly placed elements from being nudged or dragged out of position. |
| **Lock All** ($\text{🖼️}$) | Protecting a completed logo or final text. | Total security for an element that is finished and correctly placed, ensuring no further modification. |

#### 4. Special Layer Types

| Layer Type | Purpose | Icon/Indicator |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adjustment Layer** | Applies color/tonal corrections (e.g., Levels, Exposure) non-destructively to all layers beneath it. | ⚫ (Half-filled circle) |
| **Layer Mask** | A grayscale channel attached to a layer. **Black** hides, **White** reveals, and **Grays** partially reveal. Allows non-destructive hiding of layer content. | 🔳 (White rectangle with black hole) |
| **Clipping Mask** | Constrains the content of a layer to the boundaries (pixels) of the layer directly beneath it. Excellent for filling text or shapes with textures. | Arrow pointing down to the layer below. |
| **Smart Object** | A container that preserves an image's source content. Allows scaling, rotating, and filtering without permanent loss of resolution (non-destructive transformations). | Small icon in the thumbnail corner.  |
| **Shape Layer** | Layers created by the Shape tools (Rectangle, Ellipse, Custom Shape). They are **vector-based** (resolution-independent) and defined by mathematical paths, not pixels. | Square with an anchor point icon. |
| **Type Layer** | Layers created by the Type tool. They are also **vector-based** and remain editable until rasterized. | Large **T** icon. |

***

#### 5. Layer Operations (Layer Management)

* **Linking Layers:** Select multiple layers and click the **chain link icon** at the bottom of the panel to link them. Moving one linked layer moves all of them.
* **Grouping Layers:** Select layers and use **Ctrl/Cmd + G** to place them in a folder (Group). Groups help organize complex documents and allow blending modes/opacity to be applied to the entire group.
* **Flattening:** Merging all visible layers into a single Background layer. This dramatically reduces file size but destroys the ability to edit layers individually (**destructive**). Usually done only for the final save.
* **Merging Down:** Combining the active layer with the layer directly beneath it (**Ctrl/Cmd + E**).

## Crop Tool Group

<img width="263" height="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e46c9e3-dae1-4491-9f4e-88cdcaee92f5" />

<img width="1408" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3471200-70a8-48c7-8535-460dea16b3fe" />

The **Crop Tool Group** in Adobe Photoshop contains essential tools for adjusting the composition, size, and perspective of an image. These tools are grouped together in the toolbar and are primarily used for non-destructive image trimming and straightening.

## Crop Tool Group Overview (C)

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Key Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crop Tool** | **C** | Trims or expands an image and straightens crooked elements. | Resizing and Composition |
| **Perspective Crop Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Corrects perspective distortion caused by shooting an object at an angle. | Geometric Correction |
| **Slice Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Divides an image into smaller, optimized sections for web export. | Web Layout and Export |
| **Slice Select Tool** | **Shift + C** (cycle) | Selects, moves, and modifies the slices created by the Slice Tool. | Web Layout Management |


#### 1. Crop Tool (C)

<img width="376" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa83c2d3-0b54-4bd9-93be-d1b5b12557a6" />

The **Crop Tool** is used to remove unwanted parts of an image from the edges and is often the first tool used in the editing workflow to improve composition.

* **Usage:** Drag the corners or sides of the cropping border to define the new boundaries. Press **Enter** (Windows) or **Return** (Mac) to finalize the crop.
* **Key Controls in Options Bar:**
    * **Ratio/Size:** Allows you to set a specific aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 4:5) or exact pixel dimensions for the crop.
    * **Straighten Tool (Ruler Icon):** Click this icon, then draw a line across an element that should be horizontal or vertical (like a horizon). Photoshop automatically rotates the image to straighten the line and adjusts the crop box.
    * **Overlay Options:** Toggles the display of composition guides within the crop area, such as **Rule of Thirds**, **Grid**, and **Golden Ratio**, to aid in better composition.
    * **Delete Cropped Pixels:** When **unchecked** (recommended), the cropped-out areas are simply hidden, preserving the original pixels (non-destructive). When checked, the hidden pixels are permanently discarded.


#### 2. Perspective Crop Tool (Shift + C)

<img width="357" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f5beacb-d2ae-46b1-a5ae-79639435a5f5" />

This specialized tool corrects distortion that makes objects appear to recede in space, typically when a camera is pointed up or down at a subject (like a building).

* **Usage:** Draw a cropping marquee around the distorted object. Then, drag the four corner handles to align the edges of the crop with the vertical and horizontal lines of the distorted object (e.g., the sides and top/bottom of a skewed box).
* **Effect:** When the crop is committed, Photoshop de-skews or "straightens" the image so the once-distorted object appears to be viewed head-on, simultaneously cropping the image.


#### 3. Slice Tool and Slice Select Tool (Shift + C)

<img width="375" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f639bd-c691-426e-89ef-d3dd8f5cb344" />   <img width="371" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73aab51a-5078-4775-b98f-da692baf66cd" />

These tools are primarily legacy features used in web design to prepare large graphics for older or specific web formats.

* **Slice Tool:** Used to draw boundaries (slices) across an image. Each slice is treated as a separate image file when exported.
* **Slice Select Tool:** Used to select, move, resize, and assign specific optimization and naming properties to the individual slices.

* **Modern Context:** These tools have largely been replaced by modern web technologies and the **Export As** function for optimizing images.

## Frame Tool (K)

The **Frame Tool (K)** is a dedicated tool in Adobe Photoshop designed to create placeholder frames that images can be easily dropped into. It is a more modern feature intended to simplify the process of clipping content within defined shapes.

The Frame Tool is typically a standalone tool in the toolbar, often grouped with the Crop and Slice tools, or sometimes by itself if the toolbar is customized.

<img width="376" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06eabd3-2576-4c24-a910-c5738709138e" />

### Frame Tool (K)

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Selection Shape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frame Tool** | **K** | Creates rectangular or elliptical content placeholders (frames). | Rectangle or Ellipse |

#### Key Concepts

1.  **Frame Creation:**
    * The Frame Tool creates a **Frame Layer** (indicated by a diagonal cross icon on the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel).
    * Frames are non-destructive; they act as a mask or placeholder for the content inside them.
    * **Rectangular Frame:** Click and drag to draw a rectangular or square frame.
    * **Elliptical Frame:** Hold **Shift** and press **K** to switch to the elliptical shape, then click and drag to draw a circular or elliptical frame.
    * **Creating a Square/Circle:** Hold **Shift** while drawing the frame to constrain it to a perfect square or circle.

2.  **Placing Content:**
    * Once a frame is created, you can simply **drag and drop** an image onto the frame layer from your computer or from within Photoshop.
    * The image automatically scales to fit the frame, and it is **clipped** to the frame's shape.
    * The dropped image becomes a **Smart Object** inside the frame layer, preserving its quality.

3.  **Frame vs. Content:**
    * A frame layer has two components, which you can select and transform independently:
        * **The Frame:** The container itself (the visible border).
        * **The Content:** The image placed *inside* the container.
    * To select the **Content**, click the content thumbnail in the Layers panel. You can then use the **Move Tool (V)** and **Free Transform (Ctrl/Cmd + T)** to resize or reposition the image *inside* the frame without changing the frame's size.
    * To select the **Frame**, click the frame thumbnail (the one with the diagonal cross). You can then resize or reposition the frame itself.

#### Options Bar Controls

When the Frame Tool is active, the Options Bar provides settings for the frame's appearance and behavior:

<img width="783" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd84e50-80ee-44f2-8bbc-476ec4767d09" />

* **Shape:** You can switch between **Rectangular** and **Elliptical** frames.
* **Style:** You can pre-set the frame to have a **Fixed Ratio** or a **Fixed Size**, similar to the Marquee tools.
* **Frame Border:** While not always a direct option in the tool's Options Bar, you can easily add a border/stroke to the frame layer using the **Properties Panel** (select the Frame layer, and adjust the stroke settings).

#### Advantages

* **Speed:** Simplifies clipping images into shapes, especially useful for layouts and mockups.
* **Flexibility:** Allows independent movement of the image and the container, offering a high degree of control over composition.
* **Non-Destructive:** The original image remains intact, making it easy to swap content or adjust the composition later.

### Move Tool Group Overview

<img width="272" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdc4d9b-37a0-4f87-9dcc-39c279e37eee" />

The **Move Tool (V)** and the **Artboard Tool (V)** are grouped together in the Photoshop toolbar, sharing the same keyboard shortcut, and are fundamentally different in what they move: **content** vs. **canvas**.

Here is a breakdown of each tool and their primary differences:

#### 1. Move Tool (V)

The **Move Tool** is the most common tool for manipulating objects *within* a document.

<img width="378" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/167e3913-0cea-4da3-ba38-2d3b5af70445" />

* **Shortcut:** **V**
* **Primary Function:** Moves **layers**, **selections**, and **guides** within the Photoshop document.
* **What it Moves:**
    * Individual layers (images, text boxes, shapes, Smart Objects).
    * Multiple layers (by selecting them in the Layers panel or by holding **Shift** or **Ctrl/Command** while clicking on the canvas).
    * Pixel selections (it "cuts and drags" the pixels to a new location).
* **Key Features/Tips:**
    * **Quick Activation:** You can temporarily activate the Move Tool while another tool is selected by holding down **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (Mac).
    * **Auto-Select:** In the Options bar, enabling **'Auto-Select'** allows you to click directly on an object on the canvas to select its layer without needing to choose it in the Layers panel.
    * **Transform Controls:** When **'Show Transform Controls'** is enabled in the Options bar, you can quickly **resize and rotate** the selected layer(s) by dragging the handles around the object.
    * **Copying:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) while dragging a layer or selection to quickly duplicate and move a copy.



#### 2. Artboard Tool (V)

The **Artboard Tool** is used to create and manipulate a special type of layer container called an **Artboard**, which is essentially a separate canvas within a single Photoshop document.

<img width="378" height="362" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcc66fa-2523-4383-95f7-74db72e15441" />

* **Shortcut:** **V** (Click and hold the Move Tool icon to select the Artboard Tool, or use **Shift + V** to cycle between the grouped tools).
* **Primary Function:** Manages the **Artboard container**—creating new artboards, resizing them, and moving them around the workspace.
* **What it Moves/Creates:**
    * It creates a **container** that holds layers, text, and Smart Objects, allowing you to design for multiple screen sizes or layouts in one file.
    * It can move the entire **Artboard** around the document window workspace.
    * It allows you to **resize** the boundaries of the artboard by dragging the handles.


#### Move Tool vs. Artboard Tool: Main Differences

| Feature | Move Tool | Artboard Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target of Movement** | **Content** (layers, groups, selections, guides). | **Canvas/Container** (the Artboard itself). |
| **Purpose** | Arranging elements **on** the canvas or artboard. | Setting up and managing multiple, separate canvases (artboards) **within** one file. |
| **Activation** | Default on **V**. Temporarily activated with **Ctrl/Command**. | Grouped with the Move Tool; typically accessed by holding the Move Tool or using **Shift + V**. |
| **Artboard Interaction** | Moves the **contents** *inside* the artboard. | Moves the **entire artboard** and its contents across the workspace. |

## Brush Tool (B)

The **Brush Tool (B)** is one of the most fundamental and versatile tools in Adobe Photoshop, used for painting, drawing, applying color, and manipulating masks directly onto an image layer.

<img width="376" height="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08887bfd-91d4-4d77-9bcf-ea64b2dfa47e" />


### Basic Brush Tool (B)

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Shortcut** | **B** |
| **Primary Function** | Paints with the currently selected **Foreground Color** onto a layer. |
| **Painting Layer** | Always paints on the currently **active layer**. Ensure you're not painting directly on a Smart Object or Adjustment Layer without a mask. |
| **Brush Color** | Uses the **Foreground Color** (the top color swatch in the toolbar). Use the **X** key to quickly swap the Foreground and Background colors. |

***

## Key Controls and Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut (Windows/Mac) | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Brush Size** | **]** (Right Bracket) | Makes the brush tip larger. |
| **Decrease Brush Size** | **[** (Left Bracket) | Makes the brush tip smaller. |
| **Increase Brush Hardness** | **Shift + ]** | Makes the brush edge sharper (harder). |
| **Decrease Brush Hardness** | **Shift + [** | Makes the brush edge softer (feathered). |
| **Switch to Eraser** | **E** | Quickly switches to the Eraser Tool to remove paint. |
| **Color Picker** | Hold **Alt/Option** (while Brush Tool is active) | Temporarily switches to the Eyedropper Tool to sample a color from the image. |
| **Straight Lines** | Click, then hold **Shift** and click again. | Draws a perfectly straight line between the two clicks. |

> **Alt + right click + Drag Mouse Horizontaly to change Brush Size**
> **Alt + right click + Drag Mouse Verticaly to change Brush Hardness**
> **Eraser also have same property like Brush**

#### Options Bar Settings

The options bar, located at the top of the Photoshop interface when the Brush Tool is active, offers crucial controls for customizing the brush stroke:

<img width="1202" height="60" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd841051-bd28-4a49-ab90-dce27f594298" />

1.  **Brush Preset Picker:**
    * Allows you to select from various pre-loaded brushes (General, Dry Media, Wet Media, etc.).
    * Use the drop-down menu to quickly adjust **Size** and **Hardness**.

2.  **Mode (Blending Mode):**
    * Determines how the brush color interacts with the existing pixels on the layer.
    * Commonly used modes: **Normal**, **Multiply** (for shadows), and **Screen** (for highlights).

3.  **Opacity:**
    * Controls the transparency of the paint applied. A lower opacity means the paint is more transparent.
    * **Quick Control:** Press a number key (e.g., **5** for $50\%$, **0** for $100\%$) to set the opacity quickly.

4.  **Flow:**
    * Controls how quickly the paint is laid down as you drag the mouse.
    * Unlike Opacity (which is the final transparency), Flow is like the speed of ink coming out of a pen. Dragging over the same area builds up color if Flow is less than $100\%$.

5.  **Smoothing:**
    * Adds a lag to the brush stroke to help reduce jitter and create smoother curves, especially useful when drawing with a mouse or a shaky hand.

#### Brush Settings Panel (F5)

<img width="460" height="697" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992ebe79-ba67-4a84-aaf1-e58d966f849d" />

For advanced control, the **Brush Settings Panel** (Window > Brush Settings, or press **F5**) allows detailed customization of the brush tip:


#### 1. Brushes and Brush Tip Shape

* **Brushes Tab:** Allows for the selection of various **brush presets** with different textures, shapes, and behaviors (e.g., hard round, scattered, leaf-shaped). The panel shows a grid of available brush tips.
* **Size:** A slider to manually adjust the diameter of the brush tip.
* **Flip X / Flip Y:** Options to flip the brush shape horizontally or vertically.
* **Angle and Roundness:** Controls to change the orientation and flatness of non-circular brush tips.
    * **Angle:** Defines the rotation of the brush tip.
    * **Roundness:** Defines how compressed the brush tip is along one axis (a lower value creates an elliptical shape).
* **Hardness:** A slider to control the sharpness or feathering of the brush edge. A higher value means a sharper edge.
* **Spacing:** Controls the distance between the brush marks in a single continuous stroke. A lower percentage results in a smoother, more continuous line.


#### 2. Dynamics and Behavior Checkboxes

These checkboxes toggle advanced characteristics that modify the brush stroke as you paint, often in relation to a drawing tablet's pressure or stylus tilt.

| Setting | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Brush Tip Shape** | The base section for defining the size, hardness, and shape of the brush. |
| **Shape Dynamics** | Controls how the size, angle, and roundness of the brush tip vary during a stroke (e.g., fading over distance or controlled by pressure). |
| **Scattering** | Distributes the brush marks randomly around the cursor path, ideal for effects like spray, foliage, or particles. |
| **Texture** | Applies a second pattern or texture to the brush stroke for a more complex, textured look. |
| **Dual Brush** | Combines two brush tips to create a combined effect, using one brush to define the shape and the second to define the texture or mask. |
| **Color Dynamics** | Varies the foreground and background colors applied during the stroke, useful for organic or varied color effects. |
| **Transfer** (or Other Dynamics) | Controls the variation of **Opacity** and **Flow** within a stroke, often linked to pen pressure. |
| **Smoothing** | Adds a slight lag to the brush stroke to help reduce visible jitter and produce smoother, more elegant curves. |
| **Wet Edges / Build-up** | Specific controls for simulating natural media effects, like watercolor bleeding or layered paint build-up. |


#### 3. Preview Window

* A large area at the bottom of the panel displays a **live preview** of the currently selected brush tip and its current settings, allowing the user to see how the stroke will appear before painting on the canvas.

#### Common Brush Tool Uses

* **Digital Painting:** Used for drawing, sketching, and rendering artwork.
* **Masking:** Painting in **Layer Masks** (Black to hide, White to reveal) for non-destructive local adjustments.
* **Retouching:** Used in conjunction with tools like the Healing Brush or Clone Stamp to blend tones and textures.
* **Creating Effects:** Applying custom brushes (e.g., leaves, smoke, grunge) to add texture and detail.

## Clone Stamp Tool (S)

The **Clone Stamp Tool (S)** in Adobe Photoshop is a retouching tool used to duplicate (or "clone") pixels from one area of an image to another area. This allows you to hide unwanted objects, repair defects, or introduce repeated elements into a scene.

<img width="373" height="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e449b11-a7fc-4f63-a08b-ef7e6b350d37" />

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Shortcut** | **S** |
| **Primary Function** | Paints a sampled area of the image over another area, effectively duplicating content. |
| **Sampling Source** | You must first define a **source point** to clone from by holding **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) and clicking. |
| **Non-Destructive Method** | For professional work, cloning should be done on a **new, empty layer** with the **Sample** option set to "Current & Below" or "All Layers." |

### Key Usage and Controls

#### 1. Sampling the Source Point

<img width="819" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9441da-1791-4282-bc95-268198255c40" />


* **Define Source:** Activate the Clone Stamp Tool, hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac), and click once on the area you want to copy.
* **The Crosshair:** When you begin painting on the target area, a **crosshair** appears at the source point. This crosshair moves simultaneously with your brush, indicating which pixels are currently being cloned.
* **Re-sampling:** You can re-sample a new source point at any time by holding **Alt/Option** and clicking again.

#### 2. Options Bar Settings

The Options Bar at the top of the screen provides controls specific to the Clone Stamp Tool:

<img width="1243" height="62" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a42bd2-c3a9-4a03-b052-ad736dad312f" />

* **Mode (Blending Mode):** Determines how the cloned pixels interact with the underlying target pixels (e.g., set to **Normal** for a straight copy, or **Multiply** to darken the cloned area).
* **Opacity and Flow:** Control the transparency and rate of application of the cloned content, similar to the Brush Tool.
* **Aligned:**
    * **Checked (Default):** The crosshair **retains its distance** from the brush position. If you lift the mouse and start painting again, the cloning resumes from the exact next pixel in the original source area.
    * **Unchecked:** Every time you lift the mouse and start painting again, the cloning **resets** to the exact source point you initially sampled with Alt/Option-click.
* **Sample:** This is crucial for non-destructive editing:
    * **Current Layer:** Clones only from the pixels on the active layer.
    * **Current & Below:** Clones from the active layer and all visible layers beneath it. **(Recommended for non-destructive editing on a new, empty layer).**
    * **All Layers:** Clones from all visible layers in the document.

#### 3. The Clone Source Panel (Window > Clone Source)

<img width="315" height="382" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d91c492c-39eb-4d5b-bb71-93ad2f17ac9a" />

The panel is designed to manage up to five different source points and allow for precise manipulation of the cloned content before it's applied to the canvas.

#### 1. Source Presets and Management

* **Five Source Icons (Top):** Allows you to store and quickly switch between up to **five different source points** that you have sampled using the Alt/Option-click method.
* **Source File Name:** Displays the name of the image file from which the current source pixels were sampled.


#### 2. Transformation Controls

These controls allow you to transform the cloned content relative to the source area, without affecting the brush size or the target area.

* **Source Coordinates (X and Y):** Displays and allows you to manually adjust the **exact pixel location** of the sampled source point.
* **Width (W) and Height (H):** Allows you to **scale** the cloned pixels. You can make the cloned content larger or smaller than the original source pixels.
    * The **link icon** (🔒) between W and H allows you to **constrain the proportions** when scaling.
* **Rotation:** Allows you to **rotate** the cloned source content before painting it onto the target layer.


#### 3. Overlay and Alignment Options

These settings govern the visual feedback and alignment of the source.

* **Show Overlay:** When checked, a **transparent preview** of the source content is displayed inside the brush tip as you paint, aiding in precise alignment and placement.
    * **Opacity:** Controls the transparency level of the overlay preview.
    * **Mode:** Sets the blending mode for how the overlay preview interacts with the canvas (e.g., Normal, Multiply).
* **Clipped:** When checked, the overlay is confined to the boundaries of the brush circle.
* **Auto Hide:** Hides the overlay preview when you are actively painting.
* **Invert:** Inverts the colors of the overlay preview, which can help visibility when working with similar colors.
* **Frame Offset / Lock Frame:** (Often used in video or animation workflows) Controls how the source frame advances or remains locked.

## Healing Tools Group

  The **Healing Tools Group** in Adobe Photoshop is a collection of powerful retouching tools primarily used to correct blemishes, imperfections, and unwanted content in images seamlessly. Unlike the Clone Stamp Tool, which just duplicates pixels, healing tools blend the texture, lighting, and shading of the source area with the target area for a natural, integrated repair.

#### Healing Tool Group Overview (J)

<img width="287" height="163" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bdf8597-1204-43ad-98a3-b7be5537b3a1" />

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Key Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spot Healing Brush Tool** | **J** | Quickly removes small spots, blemishes, or objects with a single click. | Content-Aware |
| **Healing Brush Tool** | **Shift + J** (cycle) | Repairs larger, custom areas by sampling a source point and painting over the target. | Sampled Blending |
| **Patch Tool** | **Shift + J** (cycle) | Repairs a selected area by dragging the selection to a different source area for texture, then applying the blended fix back to the target. | Selection-Based |
| **Red Eye Tool** | **Shift + J** (cycle) | Removes the red reflection (red-eye effect) often seen in flash photography. | Tone Correction |


### 1. Spot Healing Brush Tool (J)

This is the fastest and most automated healing tool, best for small, well-defined flaws.

* **Usage:** Simply click or paint a small stroke over the flaw (like a dust spot or blemish).
* **Mechanism:** The tool analyzes the surrounding area and automatically guesses the best source texture and color to use to cover the spot. No sampling is required.
* **Options Bar: Type**
    * **Content-Aware:** (Best choice) Compares the nearby content to synthesize a realistic replacement.
    * **Create Texture:** Uses pixels around the edge of the stroke to create a texture pattern.
    * **Proximity Match:** Uses the pixels immediately surrounding the edge of the stroke.

### 2. Healing Brush Tool (Shift + J)

This tool gives the user more control over the source of the repair, making it suitable for larger or more complex repairs.

* **Usage:**
    1.  Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (Mac) and **click** to set the desired **source point** (like the Clone Stamp Tool).
    2.  Paint over the unwanted area (the target).
* **Mechanism:** It copies the **texture and structure** from the source point but intelligently blends the **color and luminance (lighting/shading)** of the target area, resulting in a seamless repair that matches the original lighting.

### 3. Patch Tool (Shift + J)

The Patch Tool is unique because it works on selections rather than with a brush.

* **Usage:**
    1.  Use the mouse to **select** the area you want to repair (the target).
    2.  Switch to the Patch Tool.
    3.  **Drag** the selection outline to a clean area of the image (the source) whose texture you want to use.
    4.  Release the mouse; Photoshop instantly applies the texture of the source area to the target area, blending colors and tones.
* **Mode Options:**
    * **Normal:** Repairs the selected area with a seamless texture blend.
    * **Content-Aware:** Provides a more fluid transition by attempting to seamlessly merge content from a nearby area.

### 4. Red Eye Tool (Shift + J)

This is a specific tool designed solely to fix the red pupil effect.

* **Usage:** Simply click and drag a small selection box around the red pupil of the eye.
* **Mechanism:** The tool detects the red pixels and desaturates them while darkening them to a natural black/gray, fixing the common camera flash issue.

## Content-Aware Technology

### 1. Traditional Content-Aware (Select Area + Fill Shortcut)

This is the fastest, oldest, and most basic way to use Content-Aware technology, often sufficient for simple spot removals.

<img width="452" height="383" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad5337b-be31-4520-a72e-c2a99d2142dc" />


| Action | Steps | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Selection** | Use any selection tool (Lasso, Marquee, Quick Selection) to draw a selection tightly around the object you want to remove. | Isolates the unwanted content. |
| **Command** | Go to **Edit > Fill...** or press **Shift + F5**. In the dialog box that appears, set the **Contents** dropdown to **Content-Aware**. | The selected area is immediately filled with synthesized content. |
| **Shortcut** | After making a selection, simply press **Delete** or **Backspace**. In the subsequent dialog, ensure **Content-Aware** is selected. | A fast, one-step removal of the selected content based on surrounding pixels. |
| **Limitation** | You have **no control** over which specific surrounding areas Photoshop uses as the source texture. It works best when the surrounding area is uniform (e.g., sky, grass, sand). |

The phrase "**preserve transparency**" is a key option in various Photoshop tools and commands, but when specifically referring to **Content-Aware** functions, it relates to the **Fill command**.

It ensures that the Content-Aware process **only affects the opaque (non-transparent) pixels** within the selection and does not introduce new color or content into the areas that are already transparent on the active layer.


#### Preserve Transparency in Content-Aware Fill

<img width="658" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ab41c9b-6e7a-4b4f-8d68-d66e851eb35e" />


The "Preserve Transparency" option is most commonly encountered and applied in the following context:

##### 1. Using the Fill Dialog (Edit > Fill or Shift + F5)

When you use the basic **Fill** command to apply Content-Aware filling to a selection:

* **Scenario:** You have a selection on a layer that contains both colored pixels and transparent areas (or a layer mask is active).
* **Location:** In the **Fill** dialog box, under the **Blending** section, the **Preserve Transparency** checkbox controls how the fill interacts with the layer's existing transparency.
* **Effect:** When **checked**, the Content-Aware algorithm is restricted to synthesizing new pixels only in the areas of the selection where pixels already exist (i.e., it preserves the alpha channel). If you were to fill a selection on an empty part of a layer, nothing would happen.

##### 2. Using the Content-Aware Fill Workspace

While the dedicated **Content-Aware Fill workspace** (**Edit > Content-Aware Fill**) does not typically have a "Preserve Transparency" checkbox in the standard sense, its behavior is functionally similar when working on non-background layers:

* **Selection:** The fill operation is fundamentally **constrained by your initial selection** and the boundaries of the image.
* **New Layer Output:** By setting the **Output To** option to **New Layer** (the recommended non-destructive method), you inherently preserve the transparency of the original layer, as the filled content is generated on a separate, fresh layer.


### 2. Content-Aware Fill 


<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a8133ae-a3ae-4257-a650-edf38d663576" />

<img width="606" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b183d59c-7fab-49d2-86e6-84fd461a2d99" />

This is the fastest method, best suited for simple removals against uniform backgrounds (like sky or grass).

* **Select:** Use any selection tool (Lasso, Marquee, etc.) to select the object you wish to remove.

* **Access Fill:** Go to Edit > Fill... or use the shortcut Shift + F5 (Windows/Mac).

* **Apply:** In the Fill dialog box, set the Contents dropdown to Content-Aware.

* **Result:** Photoshop analyzes the immediate surroundings of the selection and fills the area with synthesized content, often resulting in a clean removal.


### 3. Content-Aware Move Tool

This tool is used for relocating an object within an image, automatically filling the original hole and blending the object into the new background.

<img width="290" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a619d298-7185-4a8d-8b1a-8421aa00ed47" />

<img width="272" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f09a72ec-6934-4162-b2b4-331597127c39" />

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e32c21-b5cf-4fe7-bf3b-b53249accf01" />


| Setting | Function | Recommended Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mode: Move** | Relocates the selected object to a new spot. The original area is automatically filled using Content-Aware technology. | Moving a person, animal, or small item to improve composition. |
| **Mode: Extend** | Duplicates the selected area, then places the copy in a new location, often used to extend patterns or backgrounds. | Lengthening a cloud or extending a repeating texture. |
| **Structure** | Controls how closely the moved object maintains its original shape and integrity in the new location. | Use a **higher value** (e.g., 7) to preserve crisp edges. |
| **Color** | Controls how much the moved object's color and texture are blended with the new surrounding background. | Use a **higher value** (e.g., 7) for seamless blending when moving an object over a textured background. |
| **Adaptation** | Defines the blending method. **Very Loose** works best for uniform backgrounds; **Very Strict** works best for complex, high-detail backgrounds. |

## Eraser Tool Group Overview (E)

The **Eraser Tool Group (E)** in Adobe Photoshop contains three distinct tools designed for removing or modifying pixels on a layer. Unlike using a Layer Mask, these tools **destructively** remove or change the underlying pixel data.

<img width="282" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd5d246-19c0-4451-bd1b-e172cb4c3ced" />

| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eraser Tool** | **E** | Permanently deletes pixels on a layer, revealing the transparency or the layer beneath. | Destructive Brush |
| **Background Eraser Tool** | **Shift + E** (cycle) | Erases areas of similar color, used primarily to knock out backgrounds. | Color-Sampling Brush |
| **Magic Eraser Tool** | **Shift + E** (cycle) | Deletes all adjacent pixels of a similar color with a single click (like the Magic Wand, but deletes). | Color-Selection |

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb35cd7c-bec9-47eb-9ebc-b1d6754666c9" />


#### 1. Eraser Tool (E)

The basic Eraser Tool functions just like a brush, but instead of adding color, it removes pixels.

* **Mode:** Can be set in the Options Bar to function as a **Brush**, **Pencil**, or **Block**.
    * **Brush Mode:** Allows control over size, hardness, and shape, similar to the Brush Tool (B).
* **Result on Layer Types:**
    * **Standard Layer:** Erases pixels to **transparency** (represented by the checkerboard pattern).
    * **Background Layer:** If used on a locked "Background" layer, it erases to the current **Background Color** (the bottom swatch in the toolbar) instead of transparency. To erase to transparency, the Background Layer must first be converted to a regular layer (by clicking the lock icon).
* **Opacity and Flow:** Controls the intensity of the erasure. Lower opacity/flow means you have to brush over the area multiple times for full removal.


#### 2. Background Eraser Tool (Shift + E)

This tool is optimized for separating a foreground object from a background by selectively erasing similar colors.

* **Mechanism:** It works by continuously sampling the color under the cursor's **center point** (the "hotspot") and only erasing pixels within the brush circle that match that sampled color.
* **Options Bar Controls:**
    * **Limits:** Defines how pixels are evaluated against the sampled color:
        * **Contiguous:** Erases only contiguous areas of the sampled color.
        * **Discontiguous:** Erases all pixels matching the sampled color under the brush, regardless of where they are touching.
        * **Find Edges:** Best setting; attempts to keep the sharp edges of the foreground object intact.
    * **Tolerance:** The range of color similarity allowed for the erasure. A **low tolerance** (e.g., 20) erases only colors very similar to the sample; a **high tolerance** (e.g., 70) erases a wider range of colors.
    * **Sampling:** Determines how the tool samples the color to be deleted: **Once**, **Continuous**, or **Background Swatch**.


#### 3. Magic Eraser Tool (Shift + E)

This tool is the destructive counterpart to the Magic Wand Tool. It deletes large, solid-colored areas with a single click.

* **Usage:** Click once on an area of color to delete all adjacent (or non-adjacent) pixels of similar color.
* **Options Bar Controls:**
    * **Tolerance:** Controls the range of color similarity. A higher tolerance deletes a wider variety of colors.
    * **Anti-alias:** Smooths the edges of the erased area.
    * **Contiguous:** When **checked** (default), it only deletes pixels adjacent to the clicked spot. When **unchecked**, it deletes all pixels of similar color across the entire layer, regardless of adjacency.
    * **Sample All Layers:** If checked, it uses pixels from all visible layers to calculate which color to delete, but the erasure still only happens on the currently active layer.

## Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge Tools

  The **Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge Tools** are a set of specialized painting tools in Adobe Photoshop, often grouped together in the toolbar, used to locally modify the focus, contrast, or color distribution of pixels in an image. They are sometimes referred to as "focus tools" or "finger-painting tools."

They all share the same shortcut: **R** (in some versions, they may be grouped under another icon, but you cycle through them with a shared shortcut).

<img width="198" height="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/851d4eba-25b4-4f64-8e57-24a2897a6a9d" />

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47672592-8a19-402a-9e09-b50a263515e2" />

#### 1. Blur Tool

The Blur Tool is used to soften sharp edges or reduce fine detail in specific areas of an image.

* **Primary Function:** Decreases the contrast between adjacent pixels, making the area appear smoother or out of focus.
* **Mechanism:** It works by mixing neighboring pixels together, effectively reducing detail.
* **Options Bar Controls:**
    * **Mode:** Controls the blending of the blur effect. Usually left on **Normal**.
    * **Strength:** Determines the intensity of the blur effect (the amount of mixing). A higher strength value applies a more significant blur with each stroke.
    * **Sample All Layers:** When checked, the tool uses data from all visible layers but still applies the blur effect destructively only to the **active layer**.


#### 2. Sharpen Tool

The Sharpen Tool increases contrast along edges in a local area, making details appear clearer and more defined.

* **Primary Function:** Increases the difference in tone/color between adjacent pixels, enhancing edges and detail.
* **Mechanism:** It is the opposite of the Blur Tool, primarily targeting areas of high contrast to make them stand out.
* **Caution:** Can quickly introduce **noise** or bright halos (artifacting) if overused, especially on areas with fine texture.
* **Options Bar Controls:**
    * **Strength:** Controls the intensity of the sharpening effect.
    * **Protect Detail:** (Recommended to keep checked) Helps minimize the introduction of excessive noise and artifacts while sharpening.


#### 3. Smudge Tool

The Smudge Tool pushes and drags pixels across the canvas, simulating the effect of dragging wet paint with a finger.

* **Primary Function:** Distorts the image by pushing color from the starting point of the stroke in the direction of the drag.
* **Mechanism:** It picks up the color under the cursor and smears it along the path of the stroke.
* **Options Bar Controls:**
    * **Strength:** Controls the force of the smudge effect. A higher strength makes the pixels drag farther and mix more intensely.
    * **Finger Painting:** When checked, the tool uses the current **Foreground Color** at the very beginning of the stroke before it starts smudging the image pixels. When unchecked, it only smudges the existing image pixels.

#### General Tool Notes (Shared)

* All three tools are **destructive**; they directly change the pixel data on the active layer.
* They all function like the **Brush Tool (B)**, allowing control over **Size** (using **[** and **]** keys) and **Hardness** in the Options Bar.
* It is often best practice to use these tools on a **duplicate layer** so that the original image data remains protected.

## Layer Masks in Adobe Photoshop 🔳

A **Layer Mask** is a fundamental non-destructive editing technique in Photoshop. It is a grayscale channel attached to a layer that controls the transparency of that layer's content, allowing you to selectively hide or reveal parts of the layer without permanently erasing any pixels.

<img width="357" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e10535b-f904-4c11-b793-b54716563b30" />

### 1. Core Concepts and Principles

<img width="897" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4175d661-ef8d-4174-b64d-0690372da557" />

> The Black Circle area of the current layer get transparent, and Background layer visible to this area.

### 
| Color | Function | Result | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White** | **Reveals** | The layer's content is fully visible. | A hole cut in a piece of paper (or clear plastic). |
| **Black** | **Hides** | The layer's content is fully transparent. | The paper/plastic is covering the object underneath. |
| **Grays** | **Partially Reveals** | The layer's content is semi-transparent (e.g., $50\%$ gray means $50\%$ opacity). | Tinted glass or semi-transparent fabric. |

* **Non-Destructive:** Since you are only hiding pixels, not deleting them, you can always go back and paint with white to bring back the hidden areas.
* **Location:** The mask thumbnail appears next to the layer's content thumbnail in the **Layers Panel**.


### 2. Creating and Working with a Layer Mask

<img width="1024" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15882abe-ad26-43d8-a146-dda58f925175" />

#### Creating a Mask

1.  **Select Layer:** Click on the layer you want to mask.
2.  **Add Mask:** Click the **Add Layer Mask** icon ($\text{🔳}$) at the bottom of the Layers Panel. A white mask thumbnail will appear, revealing the entire layer.

#### Painting on the Mask

* **Active Mask:** Ensure the **mask thumbnail** is selected (it will have a thin white or black border around it).
* **Foreground Color:** Your painting tool (like the **Brush Tool (B)**) should be set to black, white, or a shade of gray.
* **Shortcut:** Use **D** to set the Foreground/Background colors to default (Black/White). Use **X** to quickly swap between them.

| Action | Foreground Color | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hiding Content** | **Black** | Paint over the image to hide the layer content. |
| **Revealing Content** | **White** | Paint over previously masked areas to bring the content back. |
| **Soft Edge** | **Soft Brush** (Low Hardness) | Creates a gradual transition between the hidden and visible areas. |


### 3. Mask Management Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alt/Option + Click** on Mask | **View Mask Channel** | Temporarily displays the mask itself (black, white, and gray) in the document window, rather than the layer content. |
| **Shift + Click** on Mask | **Disable/Enable Mask** | Temporarily disables the mask. A red $\text{X}$ will appear over the mask thumbnail, showing the full, unmasked layer content. |
| **Ctrl/Cmd + I** (with Mask Active) | **Invert Mask** | Flips the colors of the mask (Black becomes White, and White becomes Black), reversing the visible and hidden areas. |
| **Alt/Option + Drag Mask** | **Duplicate Mask** | Duplicates the mask to another layer. |


### 4. Key Applications

Layer Masks are essential for advanced photo editing:

1.  **Selective Adjustments:** Applying an **Adjustment Layer** (e.g., Curves, Hue/Saturation) and then using a mask to restrict the adjustment's effect to only specific parts of the image (e.g., brightening just the face).
2.  **Compositing/Blending:** Seamlessly blending two or more layers together (e.g., combining two different landscapes or blending a texture over an object).
3.  **Refining Selections:** Converting a selection (such as one made with the Lasso or Quick Selection Tool) into a mask provides a flexible way to refine the edges using the brush tool, which is much easier than re-selecting.
    * *To create a mask from a selection:* Make the selection, then click the **Add Layer Mask** icon. Photoshop automatically fills the selected area with **white** (revealing) and the unselected area with **black** (hiding).

## Black & White Adjustment Layer (Non-Destructive & Controlled)

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1fa3fd2-3627-49f6-a730-d131c5936715" />



* **Steps:**
    1.  Go to **Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Black & White...** (or click the **Adjustment Layer icon** $\text{⚫}$ at the bottom of the Layers Panel and choose **Black & White**).
    2.  A new Adjustment Layer will appear in the Layers Panel, and the **Properties Panel** will open with the Black & White settings.
* **Controls in Properties Panel:**
    * **Presets:** Choose from various pre-defined black and white conversions (e.g., "High Contrast Red Filter").
    * **Color Sliders:** This is where the power lies. Drag the individual color sliders (Red, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Magenta) to adjust how those original colors are rendered in grayscale.
        * Dragging a color slider to the **left (negative values)** makes objects of that original color appear **darker** in black and white.
        * Dragging a color slider to the **right (positive values)** makes objects of that original color appear **lighter** in black and white.
    * **Tint:** Check this box to add a monochromatic color tint (e.g., sepia tone) to your black and white image.
* **Non-Destructive:** Since it's an Adjustment Layer, you can always go back and refine the settings, or even delete the layer to revert to the original color image.


![color_black_white](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ead10a59-8a24-4c30-9ca2-ddbc60d8affd)

**Image > Adjustments > Black & White.**

This menu command is an alternative way to apply the powerful Black & White conversion settings in Photoshop, distinct from using the Alt + Ctrl + Shift + B shortcut or the Adjustment Layer method.

## History Panel in Adobe Photoshop 📜

The **History Panel** is a crucial feature that records every state (change or action) made to your image since the file was opened. It functions as a powerful, multi-level undo system, allowing you to backtrack to any previous state without relying on sequential undo steps.

<img width="301" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d82f7197-9873-47ac-96da-8fdae0386327" />


#### Key Features and Usage

1.  **Non-Destructive Navigation:** You can click on any state in the panel to revert your document to that point in time. This is non-destructive because it doesn't delete the states after the point you jump back to; it merely makes them inaccessible unless you perform a new action.
2.  **Number of States:** By default, Photoshop saves **20 History States**. This number can be increased (e.g., up to 1,000) by going to **Edit > Preferences > Performance > History & Cache**. Be aware that increasing history states consumes more RAM.
3.  **State Loss:** The history list is **cleared** when you:
    * Close the document.
    * Use certain destructive commands (like saving a file that converts to a non-layered format).
4.  **Creating a New Document from a State:** You can drag any state onto the **New Document** icon ($\text{➕}$) at the bottom of the panel to create a new file based on that specific historical version of your image.
5.  **Snapshot:** The camera icon ($\text{📷}$) at the bottom of the panel is used to take a **Snapshot**. A snapshot is a permanent historical state that is saved and is **not lost** even if you exceed the number of history states. This is ideal for saving a major milestone during an editing session.


### History Brush Tool (Y)

The **History Brush Tool (Y)** works in conjunction with the History Panel. It allows you to selectively paint back to a specific saved state or snapshot onto your current image.

<img width="423" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c243f6b7-821f-4e43-ac80-c18d99a496d9" />

<img width="732" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94bd1aa1-d35d-45c4-a2a0-2db8eaf49f79" />


#### Usage and Mechanism

1.  **Define Source State:** In the History Panel, click in the square column next to a specific state or snapshot. A **History Brush icon** ($\text{🖌️}$) will appear, marking that state as the source content.
2.  **Activate Tool:** Select the **History Brush Tool (Y)**.
3.  **Paint:** Paint over your image. As you paint, the tool replaces the current pixels with the pixels from the **source state** you selected in the History Panel.

#### Key Applications

* **Localized Reversion:** If you make a mistake (e.g., blurring the whole image), you can revert the entire document, mark the blurred state as the source, and then paint the blur *back in* only on specific areas.
* **Creative Effects:** It is often used for creative effects, such as converting a color photo to black and white, and then using the History Brush to selectively paint back the original color onto a single subject or object.

## The Pen Tool and Path

The **Pen Tool Group (P)** in Adobe Photoshop is a critical set of tools used to create precise **paths** and vector shapes. Unlike pixel-based tools (like the Brush or Lasso), paths are defined by mathematical vectors, which makes them resolution-independent and perfect for creating clean, scalable lines and complex selections.

### 1. The Pen Tool Group (P)

<img width="275" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7a23e90-2003-4368-913b-47d62dd96a94" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Primary Function | Key Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pen Tool** | **P** | Creates smooth, precise curves and straight line segments using anchor points and direction handles. | Drawing vector paths and complex shapes. |
| **Freeform Pen Tool** | $\text{Shift + P}$ (cycle) | Creates paths as if drawing freehand with a pencil. | Quick, natural path creation (less precise). |
| **Curvature Pen Tool** | $\text{Shift + P}$ (cycle) | Creates smooth curves by simply placing points; curves are adjusted automatically. | Intuitive curve drawing without explicit handles. |
| **Add Anchor Point Tool** | (Nested) | Adds an anchor point to an existing path segment. | Increasing path detail and control. |
| **Delete Anchor Point Tool** | (Nested) | Removes an anchor point from a path segment. | Simplifying path geometry. |
| **Convert Point Tool** | (Nested) | Converts a smooth curve point (with handles) to a corner point (no handles), or vice versa. | Adjusting the transition between segments. |


### 2. Paths: The Core Concept

A **Path** is a non-printing, vector outline composed of **anchor points** connected by **segments**.

<img width="1759" height="1559" alt="Path Segment" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d9d183b-c5eb-4871-9165-6b0327469d28" />


* **Anchor Points:** The points you click to define the path.
    * **Corner Point:** Connects two straight or curved segments at an angle (no direction handles are extended).
    * **Smooth Point (Curve Point):** Connects two curved segments smoothly. It has **direction handles** that control the depth and angle of the curve coming out of the point.
* **Direction Handles:** Lines that extend from a smooth anchor point. You drag these to manipulate the shape of the curve segment.

#### The Paths Panel (Window > Paths)

The Paths Panel is where all paths (Work Paths, Saved Paths, and Vector Masks) are managed.

* **Work Path:** A temporary path created by the Pen Tool. It must be **saved** (double-click it and name it) or it will be lost when you create a new path or deselect.

* **Vector Mask:** A resolution-independent mask created from a path, used to hide or reveal contents of a layer.


#### Converting Paths to Selections

A path is not directly editable like pixels, but it is indispensable for making perfect selections:

* **Make Selection:** Click the **Dashed Circle** icon (◯) at the bottom of the Paths Panel, or **Ctrl/Cmd + Click** the path thumbnail. This turns the vector outline into a pixel selection.


### 3. Pen Tool (P) in Detail

#### Drawing Straight Segments
1.  Click once to create the first anchor point.
2.  Click a second time to create the second point. A straight line connects them.
3.  Hold **Shift** while clicking to constrain the line to 45°, 90°, or 180° angles.

#### Drawing Curved Segments
1.  Click and **drag** to create the first smooth anchor point and pull out its direction handles.
2.  Click and **drag** to create the second anchor point. The curve between the two points is controlled by the direction handles of both points.

#### Editing Paths (Using Select/Direct Select Tools)
* **Path Selection Tool** (Black Arrow $\text{A}$): Selects and moves the entire path.
* **Direct Selection Tool** (White Arrow $\text{A}$): Selects and moves individual **anchor points** or **direction handles** to fine-tune the shape of the path.

#### Key Modifiers
| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Alt / Option** (while drawing) | Temporarily switches to the **Convert Point Tool** to break tangent lines (creates a corner point on a curve). |
| **Ctrl / Cmd** (while drawing) | Temporarily switches to the **Direct Selection Tool** to move an anchor point. |
| **Shift** | Constrains handles or lines to 45° increments. |

## Vector Shapes

**Vector Shapes** in Adobe Photoshop are mathematically defined objects that maintain their crispness and quality regardless of how much they are scaled, resized, or transformed. They are resolution-independent, making them ideal for logos, graphics, interface elements, and text.

<img width="367" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e15f431-039a-4302-923e-ecf815f931f0" />


### 1. Shape Tools (U)

Vector Shapes are created using the **Shape Tool Group (U)**, which contains several basic geometric shape creation tools:

<img width="246" height="157" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/204db0f1-1f0c-4dac-a53c-4aaac6340de8" />


| Tool Name | Shortcut | Shape Created |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rectangle Tool** | **U** | Basic four-sided shape. Hold **Shift** for a perfect square. |
| **Rounded Rectangle Tool** | $\text{Shift + U}$ (cycle) | Creates a rectangle with adjustable corner radii. |
| **Ellipse Tool** | $\text{Shift + U}$ (cycle) | Creates ovals. Hold **Shift** for a perfect circle. |
| **Polygon Tool** | $\text{Shift + U}$ (cycle) | Creates multi-sided shapes (triangles, hexagons, etc.). The number of sides is adjustable in the Options Bar. |
| **Line Tool** | $\text{Shift + U}$ (cycle) | Creates a straight vector line. |
| **Custom Shape Tool** | $\text{Shift + U}$ (cycle) | Allows selection from Photoshop's library of pre-made vector shapes (e.g., arrows, speech bubbles, hearts). |


### 2. Key Characteristics & Workflow

#### Shape Layer
When you draw a Vector Shape, Photoshop automatically creates a **Shape Layer** in the Layers Panel.

<img width="2296" height="1247" alt="Shape_Layer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ae386a2-fb50-410d-9ece-b83696be1c0e" />

* **Layer Thumbnail:** This layer contains a color fill or gradient.
* **Vector Mask Thumbnail:** A linked thumbnail shows the shape's path (vector mask), which defines the shape's outline. This is what keeps the edges sharp.

#### Options Bar Settings
Before drawing, the Options Bar at the top of the screen provides crucial controls:

<img width="1135" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c245c8c-224a-449c-896d-8363ba0719cf" />

* **Mode:** Must be set to **Shape** (the icon with a solid fill) to create a Vector Shape layer. (Other options are Path or Pixels).
* **Fill:** Sets the color, gradient, or pattern inside the shape.
* **Stroke:** Sets the color, width, and style (solid, dashed, dotted) of the shape's outline.
* **Path Operations:** Controls how multiple shapes interact on the same layer (e.g., combine shapes, subtract the front shape, intersect, etc.).

#### Editing and Manipulation

Vector Shapes are primarily edited using the path selection tools:

| Tool | Shortcut | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Path Selection Tool** (Black Arrow) | **A** | Selects and moves the entire shape path. |
| **Direct Selection Tool** (White Arrow) | **A** | Selects and moves individual **anchor points** and **direction handles** to precisely reshape the geometry. |
| **Pen Tool (P)** | **P** | Used to add, delete, or convert anchor points on the path, allowing complex modifications. |


### 3. Advantages of Vector Shapes

* **Scalability:** You can resize them infinitely without any loss of quality or pixelation.
* **Flexibility:** The **Fill** and **Stroke** properties can be changed instantly and non-destructively through the Properties Panel at any time.
* **Easy Editing:** Because the shapes are defined by anchor points, you can use the Direct Selection Tool to perform precise corner or curve edits that would be impossible with pixel-based tools.


> ### Create Custom Shape in Illustrator:
* Create a shape in Illustrator, make it by Pen Tool. Increase stroke size, **Goto Object -> Path -> Outline Path**. Copy the shape from Illustrator and paste it in Photoshop as a shape layer. Select it using path selection tool, the Right click for path Selection Menu -> Define Custom Shape. It will append in custom shape library.

> ### Illustrator to Photoshop
* Copy shape from Illustrator and paste it in Photoshop, then select peste as "Smart Object / Pixels / Path or Shape Layer". It will paste as a Vector Shape.
* Need to expand the shape in Illustrator before copying the shape.
* If paste as a Pixel, it will paste as a **Ruster shape**


### Custom Shape Tool

The **Custom Shape Tool** is a specific tool within the **Shape Tool Group (U)** in Adobe Photoshop that allows users to select and draw pre-defined vector graphics from Photoshop's library.

It is highly efficient for inserting complex vector elements like arrows, symbols, animals, and common web icons without having to draw them manually with the Pen Tool.


#### 1. Accessing and Using the Tool

1.  **Selection:** Activate the **Shape Tool Group (U)** and cycle through the options until you select the **Custom Shape Tool** (the icon usually looks like a random, stylized blob or symbol).
2.  **Options Bar:** In the Options Bar at the top of the screen, ensure the mode is set to **Shape**.
3.  **Shape Picker:** Click the **Shape thumbnail/dropdown** in the Options Bar. This opens the library of pre-loaded and custom shapes.
4.  **Draw:** Select your desired shape and click and drag on the canvas to draw it.
    * **Hold Shift:** Constrains the shape's proportions (maintains its original aspect ratio).
    * **Hold Alt/Option:** Draws the shape from its center point.

#### 2. Managing the Shape Library

#### Loading Shapes
* The shape library starts with a basic set. You can load more categories (like Arrows, Web, Nature) by clicking the **Gear icon** ($\text{⚙️}$) in the Shape Picker dropdown.
* You can also load custom shapes (.CSH files) downloaded from third parties.

#### Creating Your Own Custom Shapes
You can turn any vector path or shape you create into a permanent Custom Shape preset:

1.  Create your desired shape or path using the Pen Tool or other Shape Tools.
2.  With the path active, go to **Edit > Define Custom Shape...**
3.  Give the shape a name. It will now appear in your Custom Shape library.

#### 3. Properties and Editing

Like all vector shapes in Photoshop, a Custom Shape is created on a **Shape Layer** and remains fully editable:

* **Vector Nature:** Can be scaled, rotated, or transformed without losing sharpness.
* **Editing the Path:** Use the **Direct Selection Tool (A)** to grab and adjust the individual anchor points of the custom shape.
* **Properties Panel:** The **Properties Panel** allows you to non-destructively change the **Fill Color**, **Stroke Color/Weight/Style**, and adjust the corner **Radius** (if applicable) at any time.


### Vector Smart Objects

**Vector Smart Objects** in Adobe Photoshop are non-destructive container layers that hold vector content (like shapes, logos, or text) created in vector programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

They allow you to bring scalable, resolution-independent artwork into Photoshop while preserving its vector properties.

<img width="963" height="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5431aac-0332-46c3-bf1d-a9944c75dbc2" />

#### Key Characteristics and Benefits

| Characteristic | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Destructive Scaling** | The vector data is embedded within the Smart Object. | You can scale the layer up or down an infinite number of times without any loss of quality or pixelation. |
| **Linked Source Files** | If the Smart Object contains an Illustrator file or a vector shape, the link to the original data is maintained. | Double-clicking the Smart Object thumbnail opens the vector content in Illustrator (or a temporary PSB file in Photoshop) for editing. After saving the external file, the object updates automatically in Photoshop. |
| **Filter Flexibility** | Filters applied to a Smart Object become **Smart Filters**. | You can edit, hide, or delete the filter at any time, which is non-destructive. You can also paint on the filter's mask. |
| **Transformation** | Transformations (scale, rotate, skew) are non-destructive. | The original pixels or vector data remain intact, allowing you to reset or change transformations later. |


#### How Vector Smart Objects Are Created

Vector Smart Objects are typically created in two ways:

1.  **Importing from Illustrator:**
    * **Drag and Drop/Place:** Drag an Illustrator file (.AI) or copy and paste vector paths directly from Illustrator into a Photoshop document. Choose **Smart Object** when prompted during the Paste dialog.
    * **File > Place Embedded/Linked:** Use this command to embed or link an Illustrator file as a Smart Object.
2.  **Converting Existing Layers:**
    * **Right-Click > Convert to Smart Object:** You can right-click any existing **Shape Layer** (which is already vector) or even a text layer in Photoshop and choose **Convert to Smart Object**. This locks in the vector data into a Smart Object container.

#### Visual Clue

A Smart Object is identified by a small **Smart Object icon** ($\text{🔗}$) on the bottom-right corner of the layer thumbnail in the Layers Panel.

#### Vector Shapes vs. Vector Smart Objects

| Feature | Vector Shape Layer (U) | Vector Smart Object (from Illustrator/Shapes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Editing** | Edited directly in Photoshop using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and Shape properties. | Edited by double-clicking the thumbnail, which opens the content in a separate window (often Illustrator). |
| **File Type** | Stored purely within the Photoshop document. | Can link to an external file (e.g., a `.ai` file) or contain embedded external data. |
| **Properties** | Fill/Stroke/Path Operations are adjusted via the Properties Panel. | Adjustments are made via the external application/file. |


## Raster Smart Object

A **Raster Smart Object** in Adobe Photoshop is a non-destructive container layer that holds pixel-based image data (like photos or scanned documents) within its structure.

It is the standard way to incorporate raster images into a project while maintaining the flexibility for scaling and editing.

**Ctrl + Shift + Backspace**: Fill Background color in Non Transparent pixels.

#### Key Characteristics and Benefits

| Characteristic | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Destructive Scaling** | The original, full-resolution pixel data is preserved inside the container. | You can scale the image down and back up repeatedly without losing quality or pixel data. If you scale it down and save the file, the original high-resolution data is still retained in the Smart Object. |
| **Non-Destructive Transformations** | Transformations (rotate, skew, perspective warp) are saved as instructions. | You can reset the transformation or change the angle/size later without resampling the pixels (unlike regular raster layers). |
| **Smart Filters** | Any filter applied to a Raster Smart Object is automatically a **Smart Filter**. | Filters become editable, masked, and adjustable at any time, eliminating the destructive nature of standard Photoshop filters. |
| **Linked/Embedded** | The Smart Object can either embed the image data within the Photoshop file or link to an external source file (e.g., a `.TIF` or `.PSD` file). | Linked Smart Objects keep the Photoshop file size smaller and update automatically if the external source file is modified. |


#### How Raster Smart Objects Are Created

Raster Smart Objects are most commonly created in the following ways:

1.  **Importing Files:** Using **File > Place Embedded** or **File > Place Linked** to bring image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) into the Photoshop document.
2.  **Conversion:** Right-clicking any existing standard **Raster Layer** (or multiple layers) in the Layers Panel and choosing **Convert to Smart Object**. This packages the existing pixel data into the new container.
3.  **Copy/Paste:** Copying pixels from another Photoshop document and choosing **Paste as Smart Object**.

#### Visual Clue

A Smart Object is easily identified by the small **Smart Object icon** ($\text{🔗}$) located on the bottom-right corner of the layer thumbnail in the Layers Panel.
