### Marquee Tools (Shortcut: M)
These tools create selections based on simple geometric shapes.

* **Rectangular Marquee Tool:** Used to select rectangular or square areas. Hold **Shift** while dragging to constrain the shape to a perfect square.

* **Elliptical Marquee Tool:** Used to select circular or elliptical areas. Hold **Shift** while dragging to constrain the shape to a perfect circle.
* **Single Row/Column Marquee Tools:** Select a single pixel-wide horizontal or vertical line across the entire image.

### Lasso Tools (Shortcut: L)
These tools are for more irregular shapes, allowing for freeform or straight-edged selections.

* **Lasso Tool:** Allows you to draw a freehand selection outline. Best for quick, rough selections.
* **Polygonal Lasso Tool:** Creates selections using straight-edged segments. You click to set corner points. Ideal for selecting objects with straight lines, like architecture.
* **Magnetic Lasso Tool:** Draws a selection border that automatically snaps to the edges of objects as you drag the cursor along them. Works best when there is a clear contrast between the object and the background.

### Quick Selection Tools (Shortcut: W)
These are modern tools that help select areas more intelligently, often based on color, texture, or AI.

* **Quick Selection Tool:** "Paints" a selection by intelligently detecting and following image edges based on color and texture as you drag.
* **Magic Wand Tool:** Selects contiguous pixels of similar color and tone with a single click. The tolerance setting controls the range of colors included in the selection.
* **Object Selection Tool:** Uses artificial intelligence to automatically find and select objects in your image, typically by drawing a rough box or lasso around the area.

## Modifying Selections

Once a selection is active, you can modify it using options found in the options bar or with keyboard shortcuts:

* **Add to Selection:** Hold **Shift** and use any selection tool to add to the existing selection.
* **Subtract from Selection:** Hold **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (macOS) and use any selection tool to remove from the existing selection.
* **Intersect with Selection:** Hold **Shift + Alt** (Windows) or **Shift + Option** (macOS) to keep only the area where the new selection overlaps the existing one.
* **Deselect:** Press **Ctrl + D** (Windows) or **Command + D** (macOS) to remove the selection entirely.
